कम्प्युटर विज्ञान

कम्प्युटर विज्ञान गणित, विज्ञान र समस्या समाधान गर्ने खुबीको प्रयग गरेर कम्प्युटर को निर्माण र प्रयोग संबन्धि अध्ययन हो।

Computer science split from other sciences near the end of the 20th century, and made its own ways of doing things and its own set of word meanings. It has roots in electrical engineering, math and language science. You can think of it as a mix of science, engineering and art.

Computer science studies the theoretical (ideal, not real) parts of computers, computer engineering looks at the real parts of computers (those that you could touch), and software engineering looks at how useful computer programs can be and how to make programs.

The simplest idea of government is those who rule over people and land. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a village or as big as a continent (like Australia). Those people who rule the land can allow others to own it. It is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission. This view is called libertarianism. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in peace, without government. This view is called anarchism. 

Almost every place on Earth is connected to one and only one government. Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules, small border disputed areas and the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every place on Earth there is a government that claims sovereign control over it. The word "sovereign" is old and means "control by a King" (sovereign). Governments of villages, cities, counties and other communities are also subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist, and then to that of the country.

It is from Kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation-states came. The capital of a country, for instance, is where the King kept his assets. From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics. A government is said to regulate trade as well as to rule over land.

Governments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish. In very many countries, there are strict rules about sexual intercourse and drugs that are part of law and offenders are punished for disobeying them.

Tax is how government is paid for in most countries. People who buy, sell, import, invest, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government.

There are many theories of how to organize government better. These are called theories of civics. Because government is run by people who can be greedy, many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy. That way, if government does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next election. Still many countries' governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power.

There are many theories of how to run a government better, and keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of politics. No matter how a government is chosen, it must do politics to keep power.

There are many ideas about how to settle a dispute without needing force or violence but by talking and trusting. This is part of ethics. When religion convinces people not to fight or rely on government, we say an ethical tradition is at work. Most law comes from traditions like that. The Ten Commandments is one group of laws like that.

Governments also control people र decide things about what morality to accept or punish. In very many countries, there are strict rules about sexual intercourse र drugs that are part of law र offenders are punished for disobeying them.

There are many theories of how to organize सरकार better. These are called theories of civics. Because सरकार is run by people who can be greedy, many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy. That way, if सरकार does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next election. Still many countries' governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power.

There are many theories of how to run a सरकार better, र keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of politics. No matter how a सरकार is chosen, it must do politics to keep power.

There are many ideas about how to settle a dispute without needing force or violence but by talking र trusting. This is part of ethics. When religion convinces people not to fight or rely on government, we say an ethical tradition is at work. Most law comes from traditions like that. The Ten Commandments is one group of laws like that.

The simplest idea of सरकार is those who rule over people र land. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a village or as big as a continent (like Australia). Those people who rule the land can allow others to own it. It is a deed by सरकार that gives this right in the way that laws describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without सरकार permission. This view is called libertarianism. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in peace, without government. This view is called anarchism. 

Almost every place on Earth is connected to one र only one government. Places without सरकार are where people follow traditions instead of सरकार rules, small border disputed areas र the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every place on Earth there is a सरकार that claims sovereign control over it. The word "sovereign" is old र means "control by a King" (sovereign).

The simplest idea of सरकार is those who rule over people र land. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a village or as big as a continent (like Australia). Those people who rule the land can allow others to own it. It is a deed by सरकार that gives this right in the way that laws describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without सरकार permission. This view is called libertarianism. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in peace, without government. This view is called anarchism. 

Almost every place on Earth is connected to one र only one government. Places without सरकार are where people follow traditions instead of सरकार rules, small border disputed areas र the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every place on Earth there is a सरकार that claims sovereign control over it. The word "sovereign" is old र means "control by a King" (sovereign). Governments of villages, cities, counties र other communities are also subordinate to the सरकार of the state or province where they exist, र then to that of the country.

It is from Kings र feudalism that modern governments र nation-states came. The capital of a country, for instance, is where the King kept उनका assets. From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics. A सरकार is said to regulate trade as well as to rule over land.

Governments also control people र decide things about what morality to accept or punish. In very many countries, there are strict rules about sexual intercourse र drugs that are part of law र offenders are punished for disobeying them.

Tax is how सरकार is paid for in most countries. People who buy, sell, import, invest, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government.

There are many theories of how to organize सरकार better. These are called theories of civics. Because सरकार is run by people who can be greedy, many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy. That way, if सरकार does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next election. Still many countries' governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power.

There are many theories of how to run a सरकार better, र keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of politics. No matter how a सरकार is chosen, it must do politics to keep power.

There are many ideas about how to settle a dispute without needing force or violence but by talking र trusting. This is part of ethics. When religion convinces people not to fight or rely on government, we say an ethical tradition is at work. Most law comes from traditions like that. The Ten Commandments is one group of laws like that.

Governments also control people र decide things about what morality to accept or punish. In very many countries, there are strict rules about sexual intercourse र drugs that are part of law र offenders are punished for disobeying them.

Tax is how सरकार is paid for in most countries. People who buy, sell, import, invest, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government.

There are many theories of how to organize सरकार better. These are called theories of civics. Because सरकार is run by people who can be greedy, many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy. That way, if सरकार does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next election. Still many countries' governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power.

There are many theories of how to run a सरकार better, र keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of politics. No matter how a सरकार is chosen, it must do politics to keep power.

There are many ideas about how to settle a dispute without needing force or violence but by talking र trusting. This is part of ethics. When religion convinces people not to fight or rely on government, we say an ethical tradition is at work. Most law comes from traditions like that. The Ten Commandments is one group of laws like that.

The simplest idea of सरकार is those who सासन over जनता र जमिन. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a गाउं or as big as a continent (like Australia). Those people who rule the land can allow others to own it. It is a deed by सरकार that gives this right in the way that laws describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without सरकार permission. This view is called उदारबाद. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in शान्ति, without government. This view is called anarchism. 

Almost every place on संसार is connected to one र only one government. Places without सरकार are where people follow traditions instead of सरकार rules, small border disputed areas र the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every place on Earth there is a सरकार that claims sovereign control over it. The word "sovereign" is old र means "control by a राजा" (sovereign).

The simplest idea of सरकार is those who सासन over जनता र जमिन. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a गाउं or as big as a continent (like Australia). Those people who rule the land can allow others to own it. It is a deed by सरकार that gives this right in the way that laws describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without सरकार permission. This view is called उदारबाद. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in शान्ति, without government. This view is called anarchism. 

Almost every place on संसार is connected to one र only one government. Places without सरकार are where people follow traditions instead of सरकार rules, small border disputed areas र the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every place on Earth there is a सरकार that claims sovereign control over it. The word "sovereign" is old र means "control by a राजा" (sovereign). Governments of villages, cities, counties र other communities are also subordinate to the सरकार of the state or province where they exist, र then to that of the country.

It is from Kings र feudalism that modern governments र nation-states came. The capital of a country, for instance, is where the King kept उनका assets. From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics. A सरकार is said to regulate trade as well as to rule over land.

Governments also control people र decide things about what morality to accept or punish. In very many countries, there are strict rules about sexual intercourse र drugs that are part of law र offenders are punished for disobeying them.

Tax is how सरकार is paid for in most countries. People who buy, sell, import, invest, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government.

There are many theories of how to organize सरकार better. These are called theories of civics. Because सरकार is run by people who can be greedy, many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy. That way, if सरकार does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next election.

Those people who rule the land can allow others to own it. It is a deed by सरकार that gives this right in the way that laws describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without सरकार permission. This view is called उदारबाद. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in शान्ति, without government. This view is called anarchism. 

Almost every place on संसार is connected to one र only one government. Places without सरकार are where people follow traditions instead of सरकार rules, small border disputed areas र the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every place on Earth there is a सरकार that claims sovereign control over it. The word "sovereign" is old र means "control by a राजा" (sovereign). Governments of villages, cities, counties र other communities are also subordinate to the सरकार of the state or province where they exist, र then to that of the country.

It is from Kings र feudalism that modern governments र nation-states came. The capital of a country, for instance, is where the King kept उनका assets. From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics. A सरकार is said to regulate trade as well as to rule over land.

Governments also control people र decide things about what morality to accept or punish. In very many countries, there are strict rules about sexual intercourse र drugs that are part of law र offenders are punished for disobeying them.

Tax is how सरकार is paid for in most countries. People who buy, sell, import, invest, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government.

There are many theories of how to organize सरकार better. These are called theories of civics. Because सरकार is run by people who can be greedy, many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy. That way, if सरकार does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next election. Still many countries' governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power.

There are many theories of how to run a सरकार better, र keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of politics. No matter how a सरकार is chosen, it must do politics to keep power.

There are many ideas about how to settle a dispute without needing force or violence but by talking र trusting. This is part of ethics. When religion convinces people not to fight or rely on government, we say an ethical tradition is at work. Most law comes from traditions like that. The Ten Commandments is one group of laws like that.

Governments also control people र decide things about what morality to accept or punish. In very many countries, there are strict rules about sexual intercourse र drugs that are part of law र offenders are punished for disobeying them.

Tax is how सरकार is paid for in most countries. People who buy, sell, import, invest, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government.

There are many theories of how to organize सरकार better. These are called theories of civics. Because सरकार is run by people who can be greedy, many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy. That way, if सरकार does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next election. Still many countries' governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power.

There are many theories of how to run a सरकार better, र keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of politics. No matter how a सरकार is chosen, it must do politics to keep power.

There are many ideas about how to settle a dispute without needing force or violence but by talking र trusting. This is part of ethics. When religion convinces people not to fight or rely on government, we say an ethical tradition is at work. Most law comes from traditions like that. The Ten Commandments is one group of laws like that.

गणित

गणित is the study of सङ्ख्या, structure (how things are organized), space (where things are) and change.

Because गणित looks at such general topics, it uses abstract (simpler, less specific) descriptions of objects to talk about things. The simplest example of this is numbers. In the real world two apples plus two apples makes four apples, two bricks plus two bricks makes four bricks so in mathematics this becomes the general statement "two plus two equals four". This is arithmetic.

Another very simple example comes from set theory. If all blackbirds are black and one bird is not black it is not a blackbird. If all snow is white and another thing is not white it is not snow. In math we make this idea abstract by saying: if A is a subset of B then "not B" is a subset of "not A". For example, if you have something that is not black, it cannot be a blackbird. 

By finding a general way to say something mathematics solves many problems at the same time. The examples of snow and blackbirds are easy to understand without math, but harder situations can be much easier to understand with math. Sometimes mathematics studies rules or ideas which have not yet been found in the real world. Often if the rules are chosen because they are simple, later on they are found in the real world and studying the rules helps us understand the world better.

The word "mathematics" comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthema) and means "science, knowledge, or learning". Often it is abbreviated to maths (math in American English), especially when describing arithmetic, geometry or basic algebra as taught to teenagers (as pupils).

गणितिय prediction is the basis of hard science, which almost always uses equations to predict events in physics. The philosophy of science explores this. However, creating mathematics is clearly a human science. The philosophy of mathematics explores these issues, and others regarding how mathematics fits into philosophy, ethics and real life.

Here is a possible grouping of mathematical areas and topics.

"See list of theorems, list of conjectures for more"

Often if the rules are chosen because they are simple, later on they are found in the real world and studying the rules helps us understand the world better.

The word "mathematics" comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthema) and means "science, knowledge, or learning". Often it is abbreviated to maths (math in American English), especially when describing arithmetic, geometry or basic algebra as taught to teenagers (as pupils).

गणितिय prediction is the basis of hard science, which almost always uses equations to predict events in physics. The philosophy of science explores this. However, creating mathematics is clearly a human science. The philosophy of mathematics explores these issues, and others regarding how mathematics fits into philosophy, ethics and real life.

गणित is the study of सङ्ख्या, structure (how things are organized), space (where things are) and change.

Because गणित looks at such general topics, it uses abstract (simpler, less specific) descriptions of objects to talk about things. The simplest example of this is numbers. In the real world two apples plus two apples makes four apples, two bricks plus two bricks makes four bricks so in mathematics this becomes the general statement "two plus two equals four". This is arithmetic.

Another very simple example comes from set theory. If all blackbirds are black and one bird is not black it is not a blackbird. If all snow is white and another thing is not white it is not snow. In math we make this idea abstract by saying: if A is a subset of B then "not B" is a subset of "not A". For example, if you have something that is not black, it cannot be a blackbird.

However, creating mathematics is clearly a human science. The philosophy of mathematics explores these issues, and others regarding how mathematics fits into philosophy, ethics and real life.

गणित सङ्ख्या, संरचना, स्पेस र परिवर्तनको को वैज्ञानिक अध्ययन हो।

Because गणित looks at such general topics, it uses abstract (simpler, less specific) descriptions of objects to talk about things. The simplest example of this is numbers. In the real world two apples plus two apples makes four apples, two bricks plus two bricks makes four bricks so in mathematics this becomes the general statement "two plus two equals four". This is अंकगणित.

Another very simple example comes from set theory. If all blackbirds are black and one bird is not black it is not a blackbird. If all snow is white and another thing is not white it is not snow. In math we make this idea abstract by saying: if A is a subset of B then "not B" is a subset of "not A". For example, if you have something that is not black, it cannot be a blackbird. 

By finding a general way to say something mathematics solves many problems at the same time. The examples of snow and blackbirds are easy to understand without math, but harder situations can be much easier to understand with math. Sometimes mathematics studies rules or ideas which have not yet been found in the real world. Often if the rules are chosen because they are simple, later on they are found in the real world and studying the rules helps us understand the world better.

The examples of snow and blackbirds are easy to understand without math, but harder situations can be much easier to understand with math. Sometimes mathematics studies rules or ideas which have not yet been found in the real world. Often if the rules are chosen because they are simple, later on they are found in the real world and studying the rules helps us understand the world better.

गणितिय prediction is the basis of hard science, which almost always uses equations to predict events in physics. The philosophy of science explores this. However, creating mathematics is clearly a human science. The philosophy of mathematics explores these issues, and others regarding how mathematics fits into philosophy, ethics and real life.

गणित सङ्ख्या, संरचना, स्पेस र परिवर्तनको को वैज्ञानिक अध्ययन हो।

Because गणित looks at such general topics, it uses abstract (simpler, less specific) descriptions of objects to talk about things. The simplest example of this is numbers. In the real world two apples plus two apples makes four apples, two bricks plus two bricks makes four bricks so in mathematics this becomes the general statement "two plus two equals four". This is अंकगणित.

Another very simple example comes from set theory. If all blackbirds are black and one bird is not black it is not a blackbird. If all snow is white and another thing is not white it is not snow. In math we make this idea abstract by saying: if A is a subset of B then "not B" is a subset of "not A". For example, if you have something that is not black, it cannot be a blackbird.

In the real world two apples plus two apples makes four apples, two bricks plus two bricks makes four bricks so in mathematics this becomes the general statement "two plus two equals four". This is अंकगणित.

Another very simple example comes from set theory. If all blackbirds are black and one bird is not black it is not a blackbird. If all snow is white and another thing is not white it is not snow. In math we make this idea abstract by saying: if A is a subset of B then "not B" is a subset of "not A". For example, if you have something that is not black, it cannot be a blackbird. 

By finding a general way to say something mathematics solves many problems at the same time. The examples of snow and blackbirds are easy to understand without math, but harder situations can be much easier to understand with math. Sometimes mathematics studies rules or ideas which have not yet been found in the real world. Often if the rules are chosen because they are simple, later on they are found in the real world and studying the rules helps us understand the world better.

गणित भन्ने शब्द संस्कृतबाट आएको हो। 

गणितिय prediction is the basis of hard science, which almost always uses equations to predict events in physics. The philosophy of science explores this. However, creating mathematics is clearly a human science. The philosophy of mathematics explores these issues, and others regarding how mathematics fits into philosophy, ethics and real life.

However, creating mathematics is clearly a human science. The philosophy of mathematics explores these issues, and others regarding how mathematics fits into philosophy, ethics and real life.

गणित सङ्ख्या, संरचना, स्पेस र परिवर्तनको को वैज्ञानिक अध्ययन हो।

Because गणित looks at such general topics, it uses abstract (simpler, less specific) descriptions of objects to talk about things. The simplest example of this is numbers. In the real world two apples plus two apples makes four apples, two bricks plus two bricks makes four bricks so in mathematics this becomes the general statement "two plus two equals four". This is अंकगणित.

Another very simple example comes from set theory. If all blackbirds are black and one bird is not black it is not a blackbird. If all snow is white and another thing is not white it is not snow. In math we make this idea abstract by saying: if A is a subset of B then "not B" is a subset of "not A". For example, if you have something that is not black, it cannot be a blackbird. 

By finding a general way to say something mathematics solves many problems at the same time. The examples of snow and blackbirds are easy to understand without math, but harder situations can be much easier to understand with math. Sometimes mathematics studies rules or ideas which have not yet been found in the real world. Often if the rules are chosen because they are simple, later on they are found in the real world and studying the rules helps us understand the world better.

The examples of snow and blackbirds are easy to understand without math, but harder situations can be much easier to understand with math. Sometimes mathematics studies rules or ideas which have not yet been found in the real world. Often if the rules are chosen because they are simple, later on they are found in the real world and studying the rules helps us understand the world better.

गणितिय prediction is the basis of hard science, which almost always uses equations to predict events in physics. The philosophy of science explores this. However, creating mathematics is clearly a human science. The philosophy of mathematics explores these issues, and others regarding how mathematics fits into philosophy, ethics and real life.

गणित सङ्ख्या, संरचना, स्पेस र परिवर्तनको को वैज्ञानिक अध्ययन हो।

Because गणित looks at such general topics, it uses abstract (simpler, less specific) descriptions of objects to talk about things. The simplest example of this is numbers. In the real world two apples plus two apples makes four apples, two bricks plus two bricks makes four bricks so in mathematics this becomes the general statement "two plus two equals four". This is अंकगणित.

Another very simple example comes from set theory. If all blackbirds are black and one bird is not black it is not a blackbird. If all snow is white and another thing is not white it is not snow. In math we make this idea abstract by saying: if A is a subset of B then "not B" is a subset of "not A". For example, if you have something that is not black, it cannot be a blackbird.

इलेक्ट्रोनिक मेल वा इमेल (email वा e-mail) इन्टरनेटको सबै भन्दा बढी प्रयोग हुने सेवा हो। यो सेवा प्रयोग गरेर इमेल ठेगाना भएका ब्यक्तिहरू बिच बिद्युतिय माध्यममा पत्राचार गर्न सकिन्छ। Those are much like postal letters, except that they are delivered much faster than snail mail when sending over long distances, and is usually free.

स्वास्थ्य

स्वास्थ्यHealth is the functional and/or metabolic efficiency of an organism, at any moment in time, at both the cellular and global levels. In any organism, health is the ability to efficiently respond to challenges (stressors) and effectively restore and sustain a "state of balance," known as homeostasis. Sickness is merely the absence of health. All organisms, from the simplest to the most complex, reside on a spectrum between 100% health and 0% health. 

One widely accepted definition of health is that of the World Health Organization "WHO". It states that "health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" (WHO, 1946). In more recent years, this statement has been modified to include the ability to lead a "socially and economically productive life." The WHO definition is not without criticism, as some argue that health cannot be defined as a state at all, but must be seen as a process of continuous adjustment to the changing demands of living and of the changing meanings we give to life. The WHO definition is therefore considered by many as an idealistic goal rather than a realistic proposition.

The LaLonde report suggested that there are four general determinants of health which he called "human biology", "environment", "lifestyle", and "healthcare organization" Thus, health is maintained through the science and practice of medicine, but can also be improved by individual effort. Physical fitness, weight loss, healthy eating, stress management training and stopping smoking and other substance abuse are examples of steps to improve one's health. Workplace programs are recognized by an increasingly large number of companies for their value in improving health and well-being of their employees, and increasing morale, loyalty and productivity at work. A company may provide a gym with exercise equipment, start smoking cessation programs, provide nutrition, weight or stress management training. Other programs may include health risk assessments, health screenings and body mass index monitoring. 

An increasing measure of the health of populations is height, which is strongly regulated by nutrition and health care, among other standard of living and quality of life matters. The study of human growth, its regulators and its implications is known as auxology.

Wellness is a term sometimes used to describe the psychological state of being healthy, but is most often used in the field of alternative medicine to describe one's state of being. 

Physical exercise is the performance of some activity in order to develop or maintain physical fitness and overall health. It is often directed toward also honing athletic ability or skill. Frequent and regular physical exercise is an important component in the prevention of some of the diseases of affluence such as cancer, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Exercises are generally grouped into three types depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:


Physical exercise is considered important for maintaining physical fitness including healthy weight; building and maintaining healthy bones, muscles, and joints; promoting physiological well-being; reducing surgical risks; and strengthening the immune system.

Proper nutrition is at least as important to health as exercise. When exercising it becomes even more important to have good diet to ensure the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients whilst providing ample micronutrients, this is to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.

Proper rest and recovery is also as important to health as exercise, otherwise the body exists in a permanently injured state and will not improve or adapt adequately to the exercise. 

The above two factors can be compromised by psychological compulsions (eating disorders such as exercise bulimia, anorexia, and other bulimias), misinformation, a lack of organization, or a lack of motivation. These all lead to a decreased state of health.

Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness can occur after any kind of exercise, particularly if the body is in an unconditioned state relative to that exercise.

Hygiene is the maintenance of healthy practices. In modern terminology, this is usually regarded as a particular reference to cleanliness. The term Hygiene originates as a reference to Hygieia, who was a daughter of Asclepius and the goddess of health, cleanliness and sanitation. The related term personal grooming/grooming means to enhance one's physical appearance or appeal for others, by removing obvious imperfections in one's appearance or improving one's hygiene. 

Outward signs of good hygiene include the absence of visible dirt (including dust and stains on clothing) or of bad odor/smells. Since the development of the germ theory of disease, hygiene has come to mean any practice leading to the absence of harmful levels of bacteria.

Good hygiene is an aid to health, beauty, comfort, and social interactions. It directly aids in disease prevention and/or disease isolation. (That is, good hygiene will help keep one healthy and thus avoid illness. If one is ill, good hygiene can reduce one's contagiousness to others.)

Washing (with water) is the most common example of hygienic behavior. Washing is often done with soap or detergent which helps to remove oils and to break up dirt particles so they may be washed away.

Hygienic practices—such as frequent hand washing or the use of boiled (and thus sterilized) water in surgery/medical operations—have a profound impact on reducing the spread of disease. This is because they kill or remove disease-causing microbes (germs) in the immediate surroundings. For instance, washing one's hands after using the toilet and before handling food reduces the chance of spreading "E. coli" bacteria and Hepatitis A, both of which are spread from fecal contamination of food.

Adequate hygiene requires an adequate and convenient supply of clean water. In much of the developing world maintaining an acceptable level of cleanliness is difficult or impossible for much of the population due to lack of adequate water supply and sanitation. This results in the rapid spread and extent of diseases such as trachoma which are rare in the developed world.

Nutrition is a science which studies the relationship between diet and states of health and disease. Dieticians are Health professionals who are specialized in this area of expertise. They are also the only highly trained health professionals able to provide safe, evidence-based and accurate dietary advice and interventions.

Between the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to diseases such as scurvy, obesity or osteoporosis, as well as psychological and behavioral problems. Moreover, excessive ingestion of elements that have no apparent role in health, (e.g. lead, mercury, PCBs, dioxins), may incur toxic and potentially lethal effects, depending on the dose. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Mental health is a concept that refers to a human individual's emotional and psychological well-being. Merriam-Webster defines mental health as "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" and "mental illness" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintain satisfying relationships, and lead an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.

The above two factors can be compromised by psychological compulsions (eating disorders such as exercise bulimia, anorexia, and other bulimias), misinformation, a lack of organization, or a lack of motivation. These all lead to a decreased state of health.

Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness can occur after any kind of exercise, particularly if the body is in an unconditioned state relative to that exercise.

Hygiene is the maintenance of healthy practices. In modern terminology, this is usually regarded as a particular reference to cleanliness. The term Hygiene originates as a reference to Hygieia, who was a daughter of Asclepius and the goddess of health, cleanliness and sanitation. The related term personal grooming/grooming means to enhance one's physical appearance or appeal for others, by removing obvious imperfections in one's appearance or improving one's hygiene. 

Outward signs of good hygiene include the absence of visible dirt (including dust and stains on clothing) or of bad odor/smells. Since the development of the germ theory of disease, hygiene has come to mean any practice leading to the absence of harmful levels of bacteria.

Good hygiene is an aid to health, beauty, comfort, and social interactions. It directly aids in disease prevention and/or disease isolation. (That is, good hygiene will help keep one healthy and thus avoid illness. If one is ill, good hygiene can reduce one's contagiousness to others.)

Washing (with water) is the most common example of hygienic behavior. Washing is often done with soap or detergent which helps to remove oils and to break up dirt particles so they may be washed away.

Hygienic practices—such as frequent hand washing or the use of boiled (and thus sterilized) water in surgery/medical operations—have a profound impact on reducing the spread of disease. This is because they kill or remove disease-causing microbes (germs) in the immediate surroundings. For instance, washing one's hands after using the toilet and before handling food reduces the chance of spreading "E. coli" bacteria and Hepatitis A, both of which are spread from fecal contamination of food.

Adequate hygiene requires an adequate and convenient supply of clean water. In much of the developing world maintaining an acceptable level of cleanliness is difficult or impossible for much of the population due to lack of adequate water supply and sanitation. This results in the rapid spread and extent of diseases such as trachoma which are rare in the developed world.

Nutrition is a science which studies the relationship between diet and states of health and disease. Dieticians are Health professionals who are specialized in this area of expertise. They are also the only highly trained health professionals able to provide safe, evidence-based and accurate dietary advice and interventions.

Between the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to diseases such as scurvy, obesity or osteoporosis, as well as psychological and behavioral problems. Moreover, excessive ingestion of elements that have no apparent role in health, (e.g. lead, mercury, PCBs, dioxins), may incur toxic and potentially lethal effects, depending on the dose. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Mental health is a concept that refers to a human individual's emotional and psychological well-being. Merriam-Webster defines mental health as "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use उनका or उनको cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" and "mental illness" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintain satisfying relationships, and lead an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health. 



Health is the functional and/or metabolic efficiency of an organism, at any moment in time, at both the cellular and global levels. In any organism, health is the ability to efficiently respond to challenges (stressors) and effectively restore and sustain a "state of balance," known as homeostasis. Sickness is merely the absence of health. All organisms, from the simplest to the most complex, reside on a spectrum between 100% health and 0% health. 

One widely accepted definition of health is that of the World Health Organization "WHO". It states that "health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" (WHO, 1946). In more recent years, this statement has been modified to include the ability to lead a "socially and economically productive life." The WHO definition is not without criticism, as some argue that health cannot be defined as a state at all, but must be seen as a process of continuous adjustment to the changing demands of living and of the changing meanings we give to life. The WHO definition is therefore considered by many as an idealistic goal rather than a realistic proposition.

The LaLonde report suggested that there are four general determinants of health which he called "human biology", "environment", "lifestyle", and "healthcare organization" Thus, health is maintained through the science and practice of medicine, but can also be improved by individual effort. Physical fitness, weight loss, healthy eating, stress management training and stopping smoking and other substance abuse are examples of steps to improve one's health. Workplace programs are recognized by an increasingly large number of companies for their value in improving health and well-being of their employees, and increasing morale, loyalty and productivity at work. A company may provide a gym with exercise equipment, start smoking cessation programs, provide nutrition, weight or stress management training. Other programs may include health risk assessments, health screenings and body mass index monitoring. 

An increasing measure of the health of populations is height, which is strongly regulated by nutrition and health care, among other standard of living and quality of life matters. The study of human growth, its regulators and its implications is known as auxology.

Wellness is a term sometimes used to describe the psychological state of being healthy, but is most often used in the field of alternative medicine to describe one's state of being. 

Physical exercise is the performance of some activity in order to develop or maintain physical fitness and overall health. It is often directed toward also honing athletic ability or skill. Frequent and regular physical exercise is an important component in the prevention of some of the diseases of affluence such as cancer, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Exercises are generally grouped into three types depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:


Physical exercise is considered important for maintaining physical fitness including healthy weight; building and maintaining healthy bones, muscles, and joints; promoting physiological well-being; reducing surgical risks; and strengthening the immune system.

Proper nutrition is at least as important to health as exercise. When exercising it becomes even more important to have good diet to ensure the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients whilst providing ample micronutrients, this is to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.

The LaLonde report suggested that there are four general determinants of health which he called "human biology", "environment", "lifestyle", र "healthcare organization" Thus, health is maintained through the science र practice of medicine, but can also be improved by individual effort. Physical fitness, weight loss, healthy eating, stress management training र stopping smoking र other substance abuse are examples of steps to improve one's health. Workplace programs are recognized by an increasingly large number of companies for their value in improving health र well-being of their employees, र increasing morale, loyalty र productivity at work. A company may provide a gym with exercise equipment, start smoking cessation programs, provide nutrition, weight or stress management training. Other programs may include health risk assessments, health screenings र body mass index monitoring. 

An increasing measure of the health of populations is height, which is strongly regulated by nutrition र health care, among other standard of living र quality of life matters. The study of human growth, its regulators र its implications is known as auxology.

Wellness is a term sometimes used to describe the psychological state of being healthy, but is most often used in the field of alternative medicine to describe one's state of being. 

Physical exercise is the performance of some activity in order to develop or maintain physical fitness र overall health. It is often directed toward also honing athletic ability or skill. Frequent र regular physical exercise is an important component in the prevention of some of the diseases of affluence such as cancer, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes र obesity.

Exercises are generally grouped into three types depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:


Physical exercise is considered important for maintaining physical fitness including healthy weight; building र maintaining healthy bones, muscles, र joints; promoting physiological well-being; reducing surgical risks; र strengthening the immune system.

Proper nutrition is at least as important to health as exercise. When exercising it becomes even more important to have good diet to ensure the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients whilst providing ample micronutrients, this is to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.

Proper rest र recovery is also as important to health as exercise, otherwise the body exists in a permanently injured state र will not improve or adapt adequately to the exercise. 

The above two factors can be compromised by psychological compulsions (eating disorders such as exercise bulimia, anorexia, र other bulimias), misinformation, a lack of organization, or a lack of motivation. These all lead to a decreased state of health.

Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness can occur after any kind of exercise, particularly if the body is in an unconditioned state relative to that exercise.

Hygiene is the maintenance of healthy practices. In modern terminology, this is usually regarded as a particular reference to cleanliness. The term Hygiene originates as a reference to Hygieia, who was a daughter of Asclepius र the goddess of health, cleanliness र sanitation. The related term personal grooming/grooming means to enhance one's physical appearance or appeal for others, by removing obvious imperfections in one's appearance or improving one's hygiene. 

Outward signs of good hygiene include the absence of visible dirt (including dust र stains on clothing) or of bad odor/smells. Since the development of the germ theory of disease, hygiene has come to mean any practice leading to the absence of harmful levels of bacteria.

Good hygiene is an aid to health, beauty, comfort, र social interactions. It directly aids in disease prevention and/or disease isolation. (That is, good hygiene will help keep one healthy र thus avoid illness. If one is ill, good hygiene can reduce one's contagiousness to others.)

Washing (with water) is the most common example of hygienic behavior. Washing is often done with soap or detergent which helps to remove oils र to break up dirt particles so they may be washed away.

Hygienic practices—such as frequent hand washing or the use of boiled (and thus sterilized) water in surgery/medical operations—have a profound impact on reducing the spread of disease. This is because they kill or remove disease-causing microbes (germs) in the immediate surroundings. For instance, washing one's hands after using the toilet र before handling food reduces the chance of spreading "E. coli" bacteria र Hepatitis A, both of which are spread from fecal contamination of food.

Adequate hygiene requires an adequate र convenient supply of clean water. In much of the developing world maintaining an acceptable level of cleanliness is difficult or impossible for much of the population due to lack of adequate water supply र sanitation. This results in the rapid spread र extent of diseases such as trachoma which are rare in the developed world.

Nutrition is a science which studies the relationship between diet र states of health र disease. Dieticians are Health professionals who are specialized in this area of expertise. They are also the only highly trained health professionals able to provide safe, evidence-based र accurate dietary advice र interventions.

Between the extremes of optimal health र death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses र imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to diseases such as scurvy, obesity or osteoporosis, as well as psychological र behavioral problems. Moreover, excessive ingestion of elements that have no apparent role in health, (e.g. lead, mercury, PCBs, dioxins), may incur toxic र potentially lethal effects, depending on the dose. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how र why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Mental health is a concept that refers to a human individual's emotional र psychological well-being. Merriam-Webster defines mental health as "A state of emotional र psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use उनका or उनको cognitive र emotional capabilities, function in society, र meet the ordinary demands of everyday life."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, र competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" र "mental illness" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively र successfully a person functions. Feeling capable र competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintain satisfying relationships, र lead an independent life; र being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health. 



विश्व स्वास्थ्य सन्गठनका अनुसार "स्वस्थ्य भनेको रोग् तथ दुर्बलताबाट मुक्त हुनु मात्र नभै सम्पूर्न शारिरिक, मानसिक तथा सामाजिक अवस्था तन्दुरुस्त हुनु हो."

One widely accepted definition of health is that of the World Health Organization "WHO". It states that "health is a state of complete physical, mental र social well-being र not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" (WHO, 1946). In more recent years, this statement has been modified to include the ability to lead a "socially र economically productive life." The WHO definition is not without criticism, as some argue that health cannot be defined as a state at all, but must be seen as a process of continuous adjustment to the changing demands of living र of the changing meanings we give to life.

Merriam-Webster defines mental health as "A state of emotional र psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use उनका or उनको cognitive र emotional capabilities, function in society, र meet the ordinary demands of everyday life."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, र competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" र "mental illness" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively र successfully a person functions. Feeling capable र competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintain satisfying relationships, र lead an independent life; र being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health. 



विश्व स्वास्थ्य सन्गठनका अनुसार "स्वस्थ्य भनेको रोग् तथ दुर्बलताबाट मुक्त हुनु मात्र नभै सम्पूर्न शारिरिक, मानसिक तथा सामाजिक अवस्था तन्दुरुस्त हुनु हो."

One widely accepted definition of health is that of the World Health Organization "WHO". It states that "health is a state of complete physical, mental र social well-being र not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" (WHO, 1946). In more recent years, this statement has been modified to include the ability to lead a "socially र economically productive life." The WHO definition is not without criticism, as some argue that health cannot be defined as a state at all, but must be seen as a process of continuous adjustment to the changing demands of living र of the changing meanings we give to life. The WHO definition is therefore considered by many as an idealistic goal rather than a realistic proposition.

The LaLonde report suggested that there are four general determinants of health which he called "human biology", "environment", "lifestyle", र "healthcare organization" Thus, health is maintained through the science र practice of medicine, but can also be improved by individual effort. Physical fitness, weight loss, healthy eating, stress management training र stopping smoking र other substance abuse are examples of steps to improve one's health. Workplace programs are recognized by an increasingly large number of companies for their value in improving health र well-being of their employees, र increasing morale, loyalty र productivity at work. A company may provide a gym with exercise equipment, start smoking cessation programs, provide nutrition, weight or stress management training. Other programs may include health risk assessments, health screenings र body mass index monitoring. 

An increasing measure of the health of populations is height, which is strongly regulated by nutrition र health care, among other standard of living र quality of life matters. The study of human growth, its regulators र its implications is known as auxology.

Wellness is a term sometimes used to describe the psychological state of being healthy, but is most often used in the field of alternative medicine to describe one's state of being. 

Physical exercise is the performance of some activity in order to develop or maintain physical fitness र overall health. It is often directed toward also honing athletic ability or skill. Frequent र regular physical exercise is an important component in the prevention of some of the diseases of affluence such as cancer, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes र obesity.

Exercises are generally grouped into three types depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:


Physical exercise is considered important for maintaining physical fitness including healthy weight; building र maintaining healthy bones, muscles, र joints; promoting physiological well-being; reducing surgical risks; र strengthening the immune system.

Proper nutrition is at least as important to health as exercise. When exercising it becomes even more important to have good diet to ensure the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients whilst providing ample micronutrients, this is to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.

Proper rest र recovery is also as important to health as exercise, otherwise the body exists in a permanently injured state र will not improve or adapt adequately to the exercise. 

The above two factors can be compromised by psychological compulsions (eating disorders such as exercise bulimia, anorexia, र other bulimias), misinformation, a lack of organization, or a lack of motivation. These all lead to a decreased state of health.

Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness can occur after any kind of exercise, particularly if the body is in an unconditioned state relative to that exercise.

Hygiene is the maintenance of healthy practices. In modern terminology, this is usually regarded as a particular reference to cleanliness. The term Hygiene originates as a reference to Hygieia, who was a daughter of Asclepius र the goddess of health, cleanliness र sanitation. The related term personal grooming/grooming means to enhance one's physical appearance or appeal for others, by removing obvious imperfections in one's appearance or improving one's hygiene. 

Outward signs of good hygiene include the absence of visible dirt (including dust र stains on clothing) or of bad odor/smells. Since the development of the germ theory of disease, hygiene has come to mean any practice leading to the absence of harmful levels of bacteria.

Good hygiene is an aid to health, beauty, comfort, र social interactions. It directly aids in disease prevention and/or disease isolation. (That is, good hygiene will help keep one healthy र thus avoid illness. If one is ill, good hygiene can reduce one's contagiousness to others.)

Washing (with water) is the most common example of hygienic behavior. Washing is often done with soap or detergent which helps to remove oils र to break up dirt particles so they may be washed away.

Hygienic practices—such as frequent hand washing or the use of boiled (and thus sterilized) water in surgery/medical operations—have a profound impact on reducing the spread of disease. This is because they kill or remove disease-causing microbes (germs) in the immediate surroundings. For instance, washing one's hands after using the toilet र before handling food reduces the chance of spreading "E. coli" bacteria र Hepatitis A, both of which are spread from fecal contamination of food.

Adequate hygiene requires an adequate र convenient supply of clean water. In much of the developing world maintaining an acceptable level of cleanliness is difficult or impossible for much of the population due to lack of adequate water supply र sanitation. This results in the rapid spread र extent of diseases such as trachoma which are rare in the developed world.

Nutrition is a science which studies the relationship between diet र states of health र disease. Dieticians are Health professionals who are specialized in this area of expertise. They are also the only highly trained health professionals able to provide safe, evidence-based र accurate dietary advice र interventions.

Between the extremes of optimal health र death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses र imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to diseases such as scurvy, obesity or osteoporosis, as well as psychological र behavioral problems. Moreover, excessive ingestion of elements that have no apparent role in health, (e.g. lead, mercury, PCBs, dioxins), may incur toxic र potentially lethal effects, depending on the dose. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how र why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Hygienic practices—such as frequent hand washing or the use of boiled (and thus sterilized) water in surgery/medical operations—have a profound impact on reducing the spread of disease. This is because they kill or remove disease-causing microbes (germs) in the immediate surroundings. For instance, washing one's hands after using the toilet र before handling food reduces the chance of spreading "E. coli" bacteria र Hepatitis A, both of which are spread from fecal contamination of food.

Adequate hygiene requires an adequate र convenient supply of clean water. In much of the developing world maintaining an acceptable level of cleanliness is difficult or impossible for much of the population due to lack of adequate water supply र sanitation. This results in the rapid spread र extent of diseases such as trachoma which are rare in the developed world.

Nutrition is a science which studies the relationship between diet र states of health र disease. Dieticians are Health professionals who are specialized in this area of expertise. They are also the only highly trained health professionals able to provide safe, evidence-based र accurate dietary advice र interventions.

Between the extremes of optimal health र death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses र imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to diseases such as scurvy, obesity or osteoporosis, as well as psychological र behavioral problems. Moreover, excessive ingestion of elements that have no apparent role in health, (e.g. lead, mercury, PCBs, dioxins), may incur toxic र potentially lethal effects, depending on the dose. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how र why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Mental health is a concept that refers to a human individual's emotional र psychological well-being. Merriam-Webster defines mental health as "A state of emotional र psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use उनका or उनको cognitive र emotional capabilities, function in society, र meet the ordinary demands of everyday life."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, र competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" र "mental illness" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively र successfully a person functions. Feeling capable र competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintain satisfying relationships, र lead an independent life; र being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health. 



विश्व स्वास्थ्य सन्गठनका अनुसार "स्वस्थ्य भनेको रोग् तथ दुर्बलताबाट मुक्त हुनु मात्र नभै सम्पूर्न शारिरिक, मानसिक तथा सामाजिक अवस्था तन्दुरुस्त हुनु हो."

One widely accepted definition of health is that of the World Health Organization "WHO". It states that "health is a state of complete physical, mental र social well-being र not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" (WHO, १९४६). In more recent years, this statement has been modified to include the ability to lead a "socially र economically productive life." The WHO definition is not without criticism, as some argue that health cannot be defined as a state at all, but must be seen as a process of continuous adjustment to the changing demands of living र of the changing meanings we give to life. The WHO definition is therefore considered by many as an idealistic goal rather than a realistic proposition.

The LaLonde report suggested that there are four general determinants of health which he called "human biology", "environment", "lifestyle", र "healthcare organization" Thus, health is maintained through the science र practice of medicine, but can also be improved by individual effort. Physical fitness, weight loss, healthy eating, stress management training र stopping smoking र other substance abuse are examples of steps to improve one's health. Workplace programs are recognized by an increasingly large number of companies for their value in improving health र well-being of their employees, र increasing morale, loyalty र productivity at work. A company may provide a gym with exercise equipment, start smoking cessation programs, provide nutrition, weight or stress management training. Other programs may include health risk assessments, health screenings र body mass index monitoring. 

An increasing measure of the health of populations is height, which is strongly regulated by nutrition र health care, among other standard of living र quality of life matters. The study of human growth, its regulators र its implications is known as auxology.

Wellness is a term sometimes used to describe the psychological state of being healthy, but is most often used in the field of alternative medicine to describe one's state of being. 

Physical exercise is the performance of some activity in order to develop or maintain physical fitness र overall health. It is often directed toward also honing athletic ability or skill. Frequent र regular physical exercise is an important component in the prevention of some of the diseases of affluence such as cancer, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes र obesity.

Exercises are generally grouped into three types depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:


Physical exercise is considered important for maintaining physical fitness including healthy weight; building र maintaining healthy bones, muscles, र joints; promoting physiological well-being; reducing surgical risks; र strengthening the immune system.

Proper nutrition is at least as important to health as exercise. When exercising it becomes even more important to have good diet to ensure the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients whilst providing ample micronutrients, this is to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.

Proper rest र recovery is also as important to health as exercise, otherwise the body exists in a permanently injured state र will not improve or adapt adequately to the exercise. 

The above two factors can be compromised by psychological compulsions (eating disorders such as exercise bulimia, anorexia, र other bulimias), misinformation, a lack of organization, or a lack of motivation. These all lead to a decreased state of health.

Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness can occur after any kind of exercise, particularly if the body is in an unconditioned state relative to that exercise.

Hygiene is the maintenance of healthy practices. In modern terminology, this is usually regarded as a particular reference to cleanliness. The term Hygiene originates as a reference to Hygieia, who was a daughter of Asclepius र the goddess of health, cleanliness र sanitation. The related term personal grooming/grooming means to enhance one's physical appearance or appeal for others, by removing obvious imperfections in one's appearance or improving one's hygiene. 

Outward signs of good hygiene include the absence of visible dirt (including dust र stains on clothing) or of bad odor/smells. Since the development of the germ theory of disease, hygiene has come to mean any practice leading to the absence of harmful levels of bacteria.
