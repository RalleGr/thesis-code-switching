Religion (see etymology below) —sometimes used interchangeably with faith or belief system—is commonly defined as belief concerning the supernatural, sacred, or divine; and the moral codes, practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. In its broadest sense some have defined it as the sum total of answers given to explain humankind's relationship with the universe. In the course of the development of religion, it has taken many forms in various cultures and individuals. 
Occasionally, the word "religion" is used to designate what should be more properly described as "organized religion" – that is, an organization of people supporting the exercise of some religion, often taking the form of a legal entity (see religion-supporting organization).
There are many different religions in the world today.

The origins of the word "religion" have been debated for centuries. Some explanations for the origin of the word are:


What is clear about the word "religion" is that the religious connotations (in the sense of gods, morality, afterlife, etc.) were not a part of the term's Latin precursors.

According to the religious, knowledge can be gained from a religious leader, a sacred text, or personal revelation. It is not limited in scope and can try to answer any question. Some religious people maintain that knowledge obtained in this way is absolute and infallible (religious cosmology). Religious knowledge tends to vary from religion to religion, from sect to sect, and from individual to individual. 

In contrast, the scientific method gains knowledge by interaction with the world, and can only answer cosmological questions about the physical universe. It tries to give theories of the world which best fit the observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is tentative, and subject to later improvement or revision in the face of better evidence. It should be noted that science can not only describe the world physically, but can also state facts that aren't physical, e.g. facts of economics, linguistics or much of psychology.

Many early scientists held strong religious beliefs (see Scientists of Faith) and strove to reconcile science and religion. Isaac Newton, for example, believed that gravity caused the planets to revolve about the sun, but credited God with the design. In the concluding General Scholium to the Principia Mathematica he wrote "This most beautiful System of the Sun, Planets and Comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being." Nevertheless, conflict arose between religious organisations and individuals who propogated scientific theories which they deemed unaccaptable. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, has reserved to itself the right to decide which scientific discoveries are acceptable and which are unacceptable. Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for unacceptable scientific theories, while Galileo was tried and forced to recant the theory that the earth goes around the sun. The modern Roman Catholic Church accepts most current scientific theories, but still reserves the right to make the final judgment.

Here are a few of the areas in which some scientists and the organized Church have come into conflict from time to time.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in his autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction outside of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in his book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

The modern Roman Catholic Church accepts most current scientific theories, but still reserves the right to make the final judgment.

Here are a few of the areas in which some scientists and the organized Church have come into conflict from time to time.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in his autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction outside of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in his book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.






संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन् । ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू ।

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, संघ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन् । कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ । बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
In its broadest sense some have defined it as the sum total of answers given to explain humankind's relationship with the universe. In the course of the development of religion, it has taken many forms in various cultures and individuals. 
Occasionally, the word "religion" is used to designate what should be more properly described as "organized religion" – that is, an organization of people supporting the exercise of some religion, often taking the form of a legal entity (see religion-supporting organization).
There are many different religions in the world today.

The origins of the word "religion" have been debated for centuries. Some explanations for the origin of the word are:


What is clear about the word "religion" is that the religious connotations (in the sense of gods, morality, afterlife, etc.) were not a part of the term's Latin precursors.

According to the religious, knowledge can be gained from a religious leader, a sacred text, or personal revelation. It is not limited in scope and can try to answer any question. Some religious people maintain that knowledge obtained in this way is absolute and infallible (religious cosmology). Religious knowledge tends to vary from religion to religion, from sect to sect, and from individual to individual. 

In contrast, the scientific method gains knowledge by interaction with the world, and can only answer cosmological questions about the physical universe. It tries to give theories of the world which best fit the observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is tentative, and subject to later improvement or revision in the face of better evidence. It should be noted that science can not only describe the world physically, but can also state facts that aren't physical, e.g. facts of economics, linguistics or much of psychology.

Many early scientists held strong religious beliefs (see Scientists of Faith) and strove to reconcile science and religion. Isaac Newton, for example, believed that gravity caused the planets to revolve about the sun, but credited God with the design. In the concluding General Scholium to the Principia Mathematica he wrote "This most beautiful System of the Sun, Planets and Comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being." Nevertheless, conflict arose between religious organisations and individuals who propogated scientific theories which they deemed unaccaptable. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, has reserved to itself the right to decide which scientific discoveries are acceptable and which are unacceptable. Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for unacceptable scientific theories, while Galileo was tried and forced to recant the theory that the earth goes around the sun.

But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction outside of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in his book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.






संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन् । ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू ।

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, संघ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन् । कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ । बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 

ब्यापक अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन् । मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाईन्छ ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म" को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ । संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन् । यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ ।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई भनिन्छ । शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन् ।


What is clear about the word "religion" is that the religious connotations (in the sense of gods, morality, afterlife, etc.) were not a part of the term's Latin precursors.

धार्मिकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन् । धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ । केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन । धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारसँग ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ । 
In contrast, the scientific method gains knowledge by interaction with the world, and can only answer cosmological questions about the physical universe. It tries to give theories of the world which best fit the observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is tentative, and subject to later improvement or revision in the face of better evidence. It should be noted that science can not only describe the world physically, but can also state facts that aren't physical, e.g. facts of economics, linguistics or much of psychology.

Many early scientists held strong religious beliefs (see Scientists of Faith) and strove to reconcile science and religion. Isaac Newton, for example, believed that gravity caused the planets to revolve about the sun, but credited God with the design. In the concluding General Scholium to the Principia Mathematica he wrote "This most beautiful System of the Sun, Planets and Comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being." Nevertheless, conflict arose between religious organisations and individuals who propogated scientific theories which they deemed unaccaptable. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, has reserved to itself the right to decide which scientific discoveries are acceptable and which are unacceptable. Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for unacceptable scientific theories, while Galileo was tried and forced to recant the theory that the earth goes around the sun. The modern Roman Catholic Church accepts most current scientific theories, but still reserves the right to make the final judgment.

Here are a few of the areas in which some scientists and the organized Church have come into conflict from time to time.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in his book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.






संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन् । ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू ।

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, संघ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन् । कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ । बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 

ब्यापक अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन् । मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाईन्छ ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म" को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ । संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन् । यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ ।


धार्मिकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन् । धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ । केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन । धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारसँग ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ । 
In contrast, the scientific method gains knowledge by interaction with the world, and can only answer cosmological questions about the physical universe. It tries to give theories of the world which best fit the observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is tentative, and subject to later improvement or revision in the face of better evidence. It should be noted that science can not only describe the world physically, but can also state facts that aren't physical, e.g. facts of economics, linguistics or much of psychology.

Many early scientists held strong religious beliefs (see Scientists of Faith) and strove to reconcile science and religion. Isaac Newton, for example, believed that gravity caused the planets to revolve about the sun, but credited God with the design. In the concluding General Scholium to the Principia Mathematica he wrote "This most beautiful System of the Sun, Planets and Comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being." Nevertheless, conflict arose between religious organisations and individuals who propogated scientific theories which they deemed unaccaptable. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, has reserved to itself the right to decide which scientific discoveries are acceptable and which are unacceptable. Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for unacceptable scientific theories, while Galileo was tried and forced to recant the theory that the earth goes around the sun. The modern Roman Catholic Church accepts most current scientific theories, but still reserves the right to make the final judgment.

Here are a few of the areas in which some scientists and the organized Church have come into conflict from time to time.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in his autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction outside of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States.

In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.






संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन् । ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू ।

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, संघ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन् । कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ । बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 

ब्यापक अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन् । मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाईन्छ ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म" को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ । संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन् । यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ ।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ । त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन् ।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन् । धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ । केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन । धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ । यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ । सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ । बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोबिज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे । जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने । तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने । रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ । जस्तै, लाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो । लाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो । आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन् ।
In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in his autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction outside of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in his book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.






संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन् । ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू ।

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, संघ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन् । कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ । बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 

ब्यापक अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन् । मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाईन्छ ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म" को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ । संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन् । यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ ।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ । त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन् ।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन् । धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ । केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन । धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ । यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ । सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ । बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोबिज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे । जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने । तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने । रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ । जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो । ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो । आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन् ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in his autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction outside of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in his book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in his autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction outside of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in his book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, संघ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन् । कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ । बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 

ब्यापक अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन् । मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाईन्छ ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म" को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ । संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन् । यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन् । ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू ।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ । त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन् ।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन् । धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ । केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन । धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ । यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ । सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ । बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे । जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने । तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने । रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ । जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो । ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो । आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन् ।
धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन् । तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन् । तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन् । त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in his autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in his book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
ब्यापक अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो पनि भन्ने गरिन्छ । मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1581344589), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"<br>
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो । मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1-58134-458-9), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो । मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1-58134-458-9), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो। मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1-58134-458-9), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो। मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1-58134-458-9), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो। मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1-58134-458-9), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो। मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरू, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1-58134-458-9), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 
ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो। मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरु, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

In between the doctrines of religion and science, stands the philosophical perspective of metaphysical cosmology. This ancient field of study seeks to draw logical conclusions about the nature of the universe, humanity, and god. One important philosophical tool that attempts to resolve the conflict between religion and science is Occam's razor, which was originally developed by William of Occam to support religion but is now often used in the philosophy of science to support science. Occam's razor cuts both ways.
One should also take note of the related philosophic field of epistemology which questions the very nature of how we come to understand and accept that a belief is true or false, such as belief in Darwinian evolution as compared to Christian young earth creationism and vice versa.

Mysticism, in contrast with philosophy and metaphysics, denies that logic is the most important method of gaining enlightenment. Rather physical disciplines such as yoga, starvation, self-strangulation, or whirling (in the case of the Sufi dervishes) or the use of Psychoactive drugs such as LSD, lead to higher states of consciousness that logic can never hope to grasp.

Mysticism ("to conceal") is the pursuit of communion with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought. Mystics believe in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience. They believe that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge.

Esotericism claims to be more sophisticated than religion, to rely on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and to improve on philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation (esoteric cosmology). Esotericism refers to "hidden" knowledge available only to the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge, which is public. It applies especially to spiritual practices. The mystery religions of ancient Greece and the modern religion of Scientology are examples of Esotericism.

Members of an organized religion may not see any significant difference between religion and spirituality. Or they may see a distinction between the mundane, earthly aspects of their religion and its spiritual dimension.

Some individuals draw a strong distinction between religion and spirituality. They may see spirituality as a belief in ideas of religious significance (such as God, the Soul, or Heaven), but not feel bound to the bureaucratic structure and creeds of a particular organized religion. They choose the term "spirituality" rather than religion to describe their form of belief, perhaps reflecting a disillusionment with organized religion (see Religion in modernity), and a movement towards a more "modern" — more tolerant, and more intuitive — form of religion. These individuals may reject organized religion because of historical acts by religious organizations, such as Islamic terrorism or the Spanish Inquisition.

Mahatma Gandhi who was born a Hindu wrote the following about religion in उनका autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 

He then went on to say:

He also said the following about Hinduism:

Later in उनका life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

The word "myth" has two main meanings, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary:

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. Mythology can be a term used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. But by defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real than one's own religious stories and beliefs. 

The term "myth" in sociology, however, has a non-pejorative meaning. There "myth" is defined as stories that are important for the group and not necessarily untrue. Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, as well as being ostensibly a historical event.

These include efforts to determine the meaning and application of "sacred" texts and beliefs in the context of the student's personal worldview. This generally takes one of three forms:




There are a variety of methods employed to study religion which seek to be religiously neutral. One's interpretation of these methods depends on one's approach to the relationship between religion and science, as discussed above.










For a discussion of the struggle to attain objectivity in the scientific study of religion, see "Total Truth" by Nancy Pearcey (ISBN 1-58134-458-9), who argues that some studies performed pursuant to these methods make claims beyond the realm of observable and verifiable phenomena, and are therefore neither scientific nor religiously neutral.

There are several models for understanding how religions develop.

In the late 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century, the demographics of religion has changed a great deal.

Some historically Christian countries, particularly those in Europe, have experienced a significant decline in Christian religion, shown by declining recruitment for priesthoods and monasteries, fast-diminishing attendance at churches, synagogues, etc. Explanations for this effect include disillusionment with ideology following the ravages of World War II, the materialistic philosophical influence of science, Marxism and Humanism, and a reaction against the exclusivist claims and religious wars waged by many religious groups. This decline is apparently in parallel with increased prosperity and social well-being. It appears increasingly common for people to engage in far-ranging explorations, with many finding spiritual satisfaction वाहिर of organized churches. This is a demographic group whose numbers are growing and whose future impact cannot be predicted.

In the United States, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, studies show that Christianity is strong and growing stronger, and many believe those areas to have become the new "heart" of Christianity. Islam is currently the fastest growing religion, and is nearly universal in many states stretching from West Africa to Indonesia, and has grown in world influence in the West. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism remain nearly universal in the Far East, and have greatly influenced spirituality, particularly in the United States. Explanations for the growth of religion in these areas include disillusionment with the perceived failures of secular western ideologies to provide an ethical and moral framework. Believers point to perceived terrors such as Nazism, Communism, Colonialism, Secular Humanism, and Materialism, and the havoc wreaked by such movements around the world. Particularly vehement in this regard are Islamic fundamentalists, who view Western secularism as a serious threat to morality itself. They point to perceived decadence, high rates of divorce, crime, depression, and suicide as evidence of Western social decline, which they believe is caused by the abandonment of Faith by the West.

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:


Typical reasons for rejection of religion include the following:


Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions in a variety ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

People with exclusivist beliefs sometimes typically explain other religions as either in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. Examples include:






Exclusivist views are more completely explored in chosen people.

People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences, but see their own faith as in some way ultimate. Examples include:






People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:



People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experience and context.

Unitarian Universalism is an example of a syncretistic faith.

Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do. 

Some anthropologists report cultures in which Gods are involved in every aspect of life - if a cow goes dry, a God has caused this, and must be propitiated, when the sun rises in the morning, a God has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in उनका book "The Demon-Haunted World". 

People with this worldview often consider the influence of Western culture to be inimical. They may claim that in the United States, in particular, people go to church on Sunday and cheat their neighbors the rest of the week. Others with this world view resist the influence of science, and believe that science, or "so-called science", should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief is written into the constitution of many Islamic nations, and is shared by some fundamentalist Christians. For example George H.W. Bush, on August 27 1987 said, "No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

In addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what the most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture, and religion as not easily distinguishable, but all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.

In Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system, includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a 'bad' religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

"A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha": "O Gotama, there are Samanas and Brahmanas (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"
"The reply by Buddha was": "Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither in it is there found a Samana (priest or holy person) of the first stage (Sotapanna), nor a Samana of the second stage (Sakadagami), nor a Samana of the third stage (Anagami), nor a Samana of the fourth stage (Arahant)".

Humans have many different methods which attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it (cosmology). What is reality? How can we know? Who are we? Why we are here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Religion is only one of the methods for trying to answer one or more of these questions. Other methods include science, philosophy, metaphysics, esotericism, and mysticism. Many people use more than one of these methods.

Christianity is the religion with the largest number of professed adherents, followed by Islam and Hinduism. These statistics show the number of professed adherents of the major world religions. In addition, approximately one billion people do not profess any belief in a religion (which includes Humanist, Atheist, Rationalist and Agnostic beliefs) . These figures are necessarily approximate.



In ranking religious denominations, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest single denomination within Christianity, Sunni Islam within Islam, and Vaishnavism within Hinduism. It is difficult to say whether there are more Roman Catholics or Sunnis, as the numbers are roughly equal, and exact counts are impossible.

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अँग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरु, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।

संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा बिभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक संगठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै संगठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई 

ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो। मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता संगठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानूनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसंख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक सङ्गठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै सङ्गठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ। 

संसारमा हाल प्रचलनमा रहेका प्रमुख धर्म तथा त्यसका अनुयायी संख्याहरू

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो। मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता सङ्गठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानुनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू बिभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसङ्ख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अंग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion (रलिजन) भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरु, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

धर्म भन्नाले दैवि शक्ति, परमात्मा अथवा अदृश्य शक्तिमा गरिने विश्वास र त्यस्ता शक्तिहरू सँग सम्बन्धित नैतिक आचरण, व्यवहरार, मूल्य तथा मान्यता, सङ्घ संस्था, तथा पुरातन बिधिहरू पर्दछन्। कहिलेकाहिं आस्था अथवा विश्वास जस्ता शव्द पनि धर्मकै अर्थमा प्रयोग गरिन्छ। बृहद अर्थमा कसैले धर्मलाई ब्रम्हाण्ड र मानवको संबन्ध बारे सम्पूर्ण उत्तर मान्ने गर्दछन्। धर्म भनेको जिव वा मानवको स्वभाविक गुण हो। सम्पुर्ण मानवहरूको गुण एकै हुन्छ । मानव सँस्कृतीको विकाश सँगै धर्मको अर्थ समाज र ब्यक्ति अनुसार फरक फरक पाइन्छ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता सङ्गठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानुनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू विभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसङ्ख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अंग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion (रलिजन) भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरु, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिका बाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।
संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा विभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक सङ्गठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै सङ्गठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।

कहिलेकाहीं, "धर्म" शब्दलाई "संगठीत धर्म"को रूपमा पनि हेर्ने गरिन्छ। संगठीत धर्म भन्नाले त्यस्ता मानिसहरूको समुहलाई जनाउँछ जसले सँयुक्त रूपमा एउटै धर्म सँयुक्त रूपमा पालना गर्दछन्। यस्ता सङ्गठनहरूलाई कहिलेकाहीं कानुनी अस्तित्व पनि प्राप्त हुन्छ।

संसारमा मानिसहरू विभिन्न किशिमका धर्महरू पालना गर्दछन्। ती मध्ये जनसङ्ख्याको हिसाबले सबैभन्दा प्रमुख धर्महरू हुन् : ईसाई, ईस्लाम, हिन्दू, बौद्ध, यहुदी र अन्य धर्महरू।

अंग्रेजीमा धर्मलाई religion (रलिजन) भनिन्छ। त्यस शब्दको उत्तपत्ति निम्न अनुसार भएको हुन सक्ने विज्ञहरू बताउँछन्।


धर्मका समर्थकहरूका अनुसार ज्ञानको श्रोत भनेका धार्मिक गुरु, धार्मिक ग्रन्थ, अथवा आत्मज्ञान हुन्। धर्मको कुनै सिमा हुँदैन र यसले हरेक प्रश्नको उत्तर दिने कोशिस गर्दछ। केही धार्मिक ब्यक्तिहरूका अनुसार यस्तो तरिकाबाट प्राप्त ज्ञन नै सत्य ज्ञान हो जुन गलत सावित गर्न सकिंदैन। धार्मिक ज्ञान धर्म तथा सम्प्रदाय अनुसार अलग अलग हुन सक्छ।

तर, विज्ञानले संसारको सक्षम अध्ययन गरेर ज्ञान प्राप्त गर्दछ र यसले मात्र ब्रम्हाण्डको बारेमा सम्पूर्ण प्रश्नहरूको उत्तर दिन सक्तछ। यसले देखिएका प्रमाणका आधारमा नयाँ सिद्धान्तहरू प्रतिपादन गर्ने गर्दछ। सबै बैज्ञानिक ज्ञानहरू अस्थाई हुँन्छन् जुन पछिल्ला गहन अध्ययन अनुसार परिमार्जन तथा पुनरावलोकन गर्न सकिन्छ। बिज्ञानले भौतिक रूपमा मात्र नभैकन अभौतिक बिषयहरू जस्तै अर्थशास्त्र, भाषा, मनोविज्ञान आदि पनि परिभाषित गर्न सक्तछ।

पूर्वकालका धेरै बैज्ञानिकहरूले धर्ममा निकै आस्था राख्ने गर्दथे र धर्म अनि बिज्ञनका बिचमा सम्बन्ध स्थापित गर्ने कोशिस गर्दथे। जस्तै, न्यूटनले ग्रुत्वाकर्सणको कारणले ग्रहहरूले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछन् भने। तर त्यस्तो हुनुमा ईश्वरलाई माने। रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चले कुन बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त मान्ने र कुन नमान्ने अधिकार आफूसँग सुरक्षित भएको बताउँछ। जस्तै, ब्रुनोलाई अमान्य बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्त बनाएका कारणले जिउँदै जलाईएको थियो। ग्यालिलिओलाई पृथ्वीले सूर्यको परिक्रमा गर्दछ भन्ने उनको सिद्धान्तलाई फिर्ता लिन बाध्य बनाईएको थियो। आजकाल उक्त चर्चले धेरैजसो स्थापित बैज्ञानिक सिद्धान्तहरू मान्ने गर्दछ।
संगठित धर्महरू तथा बैज्ञानिकहरूका बिचमा विभिन्न समयमा भएका केही मतभेदहरू यस प्रकार छन्।

धेरैजसो धर्मका अनुयायीहरू धर्म र अध्यात्ममा खासै भिन्नता देख्दैनन्। तर केही व्यक्तिहरू यी दुई बिच ठूलो भिन्नता भएको तर्क गर्दछन्। तिनीहरूले अध्यात्मलाई ईश्वर माथिको आस्थाको रूपमा मात्र मान्दछन् र धार्मिक सङ्गठन तथा त्यसका क्रियाकलापहरू अध्यात्म अन्तरगत नपर्ने तर्क गर्दछन्। त्यस्ता व्यक्तिहरू आफ्नो आस्थालाई धर्मको रूपमा भन्दा पनि अध्यात्मको रूपमा ब्याख्या गर्दछन् यसले गर्दा उनिहरू कुनै सङ्गठन अथवा समुदायको सदस्य नभएको जनाउँदछ।
