Gynaecology (British) or gynecology (American) literally means 'the science of women', but in medicine this is the specialty of diseases of the female reproductive system (uterus, vagina and ovaries). Almost all modern gynaecologists are also obstetricians; see "Obstetrics and gynaecology".
It is typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option. 

As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment — the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.

The Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Virginia School of Medicine recommends that surgical devices, such as gloves, with dusting powders, including talc, should not be used during surgery because of acute and chronic problems that may occur if it finds its way into adominal cavity via the vagina. It also makes an analogy to condoms which have the very same dusting powders used on them.

Some of the investigations used in gynaecology are:

MRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.

The main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:

Obviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist.

Occasionally gynaecologists will use drugs, such as clomiphene (which stimulates ovulation), and, most famously, oral contraceptives (which are also used for dysmenorrhoea).

Surgery, however, is the mainstay of gynaecological therapy. For historical reasons, gynaecologists are not usually considered 
"surgeons" - this has always been the source of some controversy - though modern advancements in both fields have blurred many of the once rigid lines of distinction. The rise of sub-speciatlies within gynaecology which are primarily surgical in nature (for example, urogynaecology and gynecological oncology) have strengthened the reputations of gynaecologists as surgical practitioners, and many surgeons and surgical societies have come to view gynaecologists as comrades of sorts. As proof of this changing attitude, gynaecologists are now eligible for fellowship in both the American and Royal Colleges of Surgeons, and many newer surgical textbooks include chapters on (at least basic) gynecological surgery.

The rise of sub-speciatlies within gynaecology which are primarily surgical in nature (for example, urogynaecology र gynecological oncology) have strengthened the reputations of gynaecologists as surgical practitioners, र many surgeons र surgical societies have come to view gynaecologists as comrades of sorts. As proof of this changing attitude, gynaecologists are now eligible for fellowship in both the American र Royal Colleges of Surgeons, र many newer surgical textbooks include chapters on (at least basic) gynecological surgery. 

Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include:



Gynaecology (British) or gynecology (American) literally means 'the science of women', but in medicine this is the specialty of diseases of the female reproductive system (uterus, vagina र ovaries). Almost all modern gynaecologists are also obstetricians; see "Obstetrics र gynaecology".
It is typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law र many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, र some women select that option. 

As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history र examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, र that it involves special equipment — the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus र ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.

The Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Virginia School of Medicine recommends that surgical devices, such as gloves, with dusting powders, including talc, should not be used during surgery because of acute र chronic problems that may occur if it finds its way into adominal cavity via the vagina. It also makes an analogy to condoms which have the very same dusting powders used on them.

Some of the investigations used in gynaecology are:

MRI र CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) र to measure the pelvic girdle.

The main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:

Obviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist.

Occasionally gynaecologists will use drugs, such as clomiphene (which stimulates ovulation), and, most famously, oral contraceptives (which are also used for dysmenorrhoea).

Obviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist.

Occasionally gynaecologists will use drugs, such as clomiphene (which stimulates ovulation), and, most famously, oral contraceptives (which are also used for dysmenorrhoea).

Surgery, however, is the mainstay of gynaecological therapy. For historical reasons, gynaecologists are not usually considered 
"surgeons" - this has always been the source of some controversy - though modern advancements in both fields have blurred many of the once rigid lines of distinction. The rise of sub-speciatlies within gynaecology which are primarily surgical in nature (for example, urogynaecology र gynecological oncology) have strengthened the reputations of gynaecologists as surgical practitioners, र many surgeons र surgical societies have come to view gynaecologists as comrades of sorts. As proof of this changing attitude, gynaecologists are now eligible for fellowship in both the American र Royal Colleges of Surgeons, र many newer surgical textbooks include chapters on (at least basic) gynecological surgery. 

Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include:



Gynaecology (British) or gynecology (American) literally means 'the science of women', but in medicine this is the specialty of diseases of the female reproductive system (uterus, vagina र ovaries). Almost all modern gynaecologists are also obstetricians; see "Obstetrics र gynaecology".
It is typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law र many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, र some women select that option. 

As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history र examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, र that it involves special equipment — the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus र ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.

The Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Virginia School of Medicine recommends that surgical devices, such as gloves, with dusting powders, including talc, should not be used during surgery because of acute र chronic problems that may occur if it finds its way into adominal cavity via the vagina. It also makes an analogy to condoms which have the very same dusting powders used on them.

The Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Virginia School of Medicine recommends that surgical devices, such as gloves, with dusting powders, including talc, should not be used during surgery because of acute र chronic problems that may occur if it finds its way into adominal cavity via the vagina.

Some of the investigations used in gynaecology are:

MRI र CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) र to measure the pelvic girdle.

The main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:

Obviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist.

Occasionally gynaecologists will use drugs, such as clomiphene (which stimulates ovulation), and, most famously, oral contraceptives (which are also used for dysmenorrhoea).

Surgery, however, is the mainstay of gynaecological therapy. For historical reasons, gynaecologists are not usually considered 
"surgeons" - this has always been the source of some controversy - though modern advancements in both fields have blurred many of the once rigid lines of distinction. The rise of sub-speciatlies within gynaecology which are primarily surgical in nature (for example, urogynaecology र gynecological oncology) have strengthened the reputations of gynaecologists as surgical practitioners, र many surgeons र surgical societies have come to view gynaecologists as comrades of sorts.

Gynaecology (British) or gynecology (American) literally means 'the science of women', but in medicine this is the specialty of diseases of the female reproductive system (uterus, vagina र ovaries). Almost all modern gynaecologists are also obstetricians; see "Obstetrics र gynaecology".

It is typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first.

As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history र examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, र that it involves special equipment — the speculum.

However, in the United States, law र many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, र some women select that option. 

As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history र examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, र that it involves special equipment — the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus र ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.

The Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Virginia School of Medicine recommends that surgical devices, such as gloves, with dusting powders, including talc, should not be used during surgery because of acute र chronic problems that may occur if it finds its way into adominal cavity via the vagina. It also makes an analogy to condoms which have the very same dusting powders used on them.

Some of the investigations used in gynaecology are:

MRI र CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) र to measure the pelvic girdle.

The main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:

Obviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist.

Occasionally gynaecologists will use drugs, such as clomiphene (which stimulates ovulation), and, most famously, oral contraceptives (which are also used for dysmenorrhoea).

Surgery, however, is the mainstay of gynaecological therapy. For historical reasons, gynaecologists are not usually considered 
"surgeons" - this has always been the source of some controversy - though modern advancements in both fields have blurred many of the once rigid lines of distinction. The rise of sub-speciatlies within gynaecology which are primarily surgical in nature (for example, urogynaecology र gynecological oncology) have strengthened the reputations of gynaecologists as surgical practitioners, र many surgeons र surgical societies have come to view gynaecologists as comrades of sorts. As proof of this changing attitude, gynaecologists are now eligible for fellowship in both the American र Royal Colleges of Surgeons, र many newer surgical textbooks include chapters on (at least basic) gynecological surgery. 

Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include:



Gynaecology (British) or gynecology (American) literally means 'the science of women', but in medicine this is the specialty of diseases of the female reproductive system (uterus, vagina र ovaries). Almost all modern gynaecologists are also obstetricians; see "Obstetrics र gynaecology".

Cardiology is the branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the heart and blood vessels. The field is commonly divided in the branches of "congenital heart defects", "coronary artery disease", "heart failure", "valvular heart disease" and "electrophysiology". Physicians specializing in this field of medicine are called cardiologists.

The term "cardiology" is derived from the Greek word "καρδιά" (transliterated as "kardia" and meaning "heart" or "inner self").

In medicine, infectious disease or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a virus, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria and viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi and protozoa, also cause disease. Prions are borderline, and memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious disease is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes disease by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, and other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious disease requires an "agent" and a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold and tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious disease killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd and Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every disease, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, and diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles and tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas disease, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism and its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses and the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived and reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes and their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human disease.

Several human activities have led to the emergence and spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence and transmission is complex, and has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe and a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis and therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history and physical examination, and imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious disease is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" and most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL and TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA and its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given disease is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients and not in controls, and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were tried and tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious disease are called "infectiologists" or "infectious disease specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious disease team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients and doctors on one hand and laboratory scientists and immunologists on the other hand.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing easy visualization of bacteria.

Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases can be caused by infectious agents, and developed a vaccine for rabies.

Robert Koch, mentioned above, gave the study of infectious diseases a scientific basis by formulating Koch's postulates.

Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin developed successful vaccines for Smallpox and polio, reducing the threat of these debilitating diseases.

Alexander Fleming discovers the world's first antibiotic Penicillin which in turn inspired the discovery of the other antibiotics available today.

Gerhard Domagk develops Sulphonamides, the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs.

Infectious disease requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious disease killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every disease, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, र diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles र tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory र diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas disease, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human disease.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious disease is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA र its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given disease is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious disease are called "infectiologists" or "infectious disease specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious disease team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing easy visualization of bacteria.

Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases can be caused by infectious agents, र developed a vaccine for rabies.

Robert Koch, mentioned above, gave the study of infectious diseases a scientific basis by formulating Koch's postulates.

Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk र Albert Sabin developed successful vaccines for Smallpox र polio, reducing the threat of these debilitating diseases.

Alexander Fleming discovers the world's first antibiotic Penicillin which in turn inspired the discovery of the other antibiotics available today.

Gerhard Domagk develops Sulphonamides, the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs.




In medicine, infectious disease or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a virus, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause disease. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious disease is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human disease.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious disease is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA र its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given disease is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious disease are called "infectiologists" or "infectious disease specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious disease team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing easy visualization of bacteria.

Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases can be caused by infectious agents, र developed a vaccine for rabies.

Robert Koch, mentioned above, gave the study of infectious diseases a scientific basis by formulating Koch's postulates.

Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk र Albert Sabin developed successful vaccines for Smallpox र polio, reducing the threat of these debilitating diseases.

Alexander Fleming discovers the world's first antibiotic Penicillin which in turn inspired the discovery of the other antibiotics available today.

Gerhard Domagk develops Sulphonamides, the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs.




In medicine, infectious disease or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a virus, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause disease. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious disease is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes disease by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, र other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious disease requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious disease killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every disease, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, र diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles र tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory र diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas disease, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms.

One way of proving that a given disease is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious disease are called "infectiologists" or "infectious disease specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious disease team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

In medicine, infectious disease or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a virus, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause disease. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious disease is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes disease by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, र other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious disease requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious disease killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every disease, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, र diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles र tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory र diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas disease, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human disease.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious disease is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

In medicine, infectious disease or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a virus, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause disease. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious disease is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes disease by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, र other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious disease requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious disease killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every disease, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, र diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles र tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory र diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas disease, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human disease.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious disease is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA र its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given disease is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious disease are called "infectiologists" or "infectious disease specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious disease team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing easy visualization of bacteria.

The top three single agent disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every disease, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, र diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles र tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory र diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas disease, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human disease.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious disease is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA र its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given disease is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious disease are called "infectiologists" or "infectious disease specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious disease team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing easy visualization of bacteria.

Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases can be caused by infectious agents, र developed a vaccine for rabies.

Robert Koch, mentioned above, gave the study of infectious diseases a scientific basis by formulating Koch's postulates.

Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk र Albert Sabin developed successful vaccines for Smallpox र polio, reducing the threat of these debilitating diseases.

Alexander Fleming discovers the world's first antibiotic Penicillin which in turn inspired the discovery of the other antibiotics available today.

Gerhard Domagk develops Sulphonamides, the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs.




In medicine, infectious disease or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a virus, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause disease. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious disease is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes disease by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, र other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious disease requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious disease is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA र its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given disease is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious disease are called "infectiologists" or "infectious disease specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious disease team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing easy visualization of bacteria.

Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases can be caused by infectious agents, र developed a vaccine for rabies.

Robert Koch, mentioned above, gave the study of infectious diseases a scientific basis by formulating Koch's postulates.

Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk र Albert Sabin developed successful vaccines for Smallpox र polio, reducing the threat of these debilitating diseases.

Alexander Fleming discovers the world's first antibiotic Penicillin which in turn inspired the discovery of the other antibiotics available today.

In medicine, infectious disease or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a virus, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause disease. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious disease is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes disease by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, र other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious disease requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious disease killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every disease, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, र diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles र tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory र diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas disease, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human disease.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols).

For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious disease are called "infectiologists" or "infectious disease specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious disease team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

In medicine, infectious disease or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a virus, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause disease. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious disease is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes disease by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, र other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious disease requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious disease killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every disease, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, र diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles र tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory र diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas disease, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human disease.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious disease is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA र its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given disease is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause disease. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious disease is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes disease by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, र other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious disease requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious disease killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every disease, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, र diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles र tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory र diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas disease, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human disease.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious disease is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA र its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given disease is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious disease are called "infectiologists" or "infectious disease specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious disease team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing easy visualization of bacteria.

Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases can be caused by infectious agents, र developed a vaccine for rabies.

Robert Koch, mentioned above, gave the study of infectious diseases a scientific basis by formulating Koch's postulates.

Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk र Albert Sabin developed successful vaccines for Smallpox र polio, reducing the threat of these debilitating diseases.

Alexander Fleming discovers the world's first antibiotic Penicillin which in turn inspired the discovery of the other antibiotics available today.

Gerhard Domagk develops Sulphonamides, the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs.




In medicine, infectious disease or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a virus, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Tropical diseases include Chagas रोग, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a रोग that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human रोग.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a रोग is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new रोग that death rates are highest.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious रोग is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA र its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given रोग is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the रोग. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study रोग in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a रोग outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious रोग are called "infectiologists" or "infectious रोग specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious रोग team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing easy visualization of bacteria.

Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases can be caused by infectious agents, र developed a vaccine for rabies.

Robert Koch, mentioned above, gave the study of infectious diseases a scientific basis by formulating Koch's postulates.

Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk र Albert Sabin developed successful vaccines for Smallpox र polio, reducing the threat of these debilitating diseases.

Alexander Fleming discovers the world's first antibiotic Penicillin which in turn inspired the discovery of the other antibiotics available today.

Gerhard Domagk develops Sulphonamides, the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs.




In medicine, infectious रोग or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a भाइरस, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause रोग. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious रोग is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes रोग by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, र other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious रोग requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of रोग (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious रोग killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent रोग killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every रोग, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

The field of "infectious diseases" also occupies itself with the diagnosis र therapy of infection.

"Diagnosis" is initially by medical history र physical examination, र imaging (such as X-rays), but the principal tool in infectious रोग is the microbiological culture. In a culture, a growth medium is provided for a particular agent. After inoculation of a specimen of diseased fluid or tissue onto the medium, it is determined whether bacterial growth occurs. This works for a number of bacteria, for example Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.

Certain agents cannot be cultured, for example the above-mentioned "Treponema pallidum" र most viruses. The first serological markers were developed to diagnose syphilis (the Wassermann test, later replaced by the VDRL र TPHA tests). Serology involves detecting the antibodies against an infectious agent in the patient's blood. In immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS), serology can be troublesome, because the antibody reaction is blunted.

A more recent development is direct detection of viral proteins and/or DNA in blood or secretions. This can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), involving the amplification of viral DNA र its subsequent detection with anti-DNA probes.

One way of proving that a given रोग is "infectious", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (Robert Koch), which demand that the infectious agent is identified in patients र not in controls, र that patients who contract the agent also develop the रोग. These postulates were tried र tested in the discovery of Mycobacteria as the cause for tuberculosis. Often, it is not possible to meet some of the criteria, even in diseases that are quite clearly infectious. For example, "Treponema pallidum", the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes].

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study रोग in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a रोग outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

When a culture has proven to be positive, the sensitivity (or, conversely, the antibiotic resistance) of an agent can be determined by exposing it to test doses of antibiotic. This way, the microbiologist determines how sensitive the target bacterium is to a certain antibiotic. This is usually reported as being: Sensitive, Intermediate or Resistant. The "antibiogram" can then be used to determine optimal therapy for the patient. This can reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics र lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

Doctors who specialise in the medical treatment of infectious रोग are called "infectiologists" or "infectious रोग specialists". Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).

The services of the infectious रोग team are called for when:

The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with patients र doctors on one hand र laboratory scientists र immunologists on the other hand.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing easy visualization of bacteria.

In medicine, infectious रोग or communicable disease is disease caused by a biological agent such as by a भाइरस, bacterium or parasite. This is contrasted to physical causes, such as burns or chemical ones such as through intoxication.

Infectious diseases are the invasion of a host organism by a foreign replicator, generally microorganisms, often called "microbes," that are invisible to the naked eye. Microbes that cause illness are also known as "pathogens." The most common pathogens are various bacteria र viruses, though a number of other microorganisms, including some kinds of fungi र protozoa, also cause रोग. Prions are borderline, र memes would not usually be considered in this scope. An infectious रोग is termed "contagious" if it is easily transmitted from one person to another.

An organism that a microbe infects is known as the host for that microbe. In the human host, a microorganism causes रोग by either disrupting a vital body process or stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. An immune response against a pathogen, which can include a high fever, inflammation, र other damaging symptoms, can be more devastating than the direct damage caused by the microbe.

Infectious रोग requires an "agent" र a "mode of transmission" (or "vector"). A good example is malaria, which is caused by Plasmodial parasites, chiefly "Plasmodium falciparum" but does not affect humans unless the vector, the Anopheles mosquito, is around to introduce the parasite into the human bloodstream.

The vector does not have to be biological. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by droplets which enter the airway (e.g. common cold र tuberculosis).

The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of रोग (ICD) code categories. The following table lists the top infectious रोग killers which caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2002 (estimated). 1993 data is also included for comparison. 

The top three single agent रोग killers are HIV/AIDS, TB र malaria. From 1993 to 2002, the death ranking for AIDS went up from 7th to 2nd र Hepatitis B went down from 6th to 11th. While the number of deaths has decreased in almost every रोग, it has increased four-fold in AIDS.

Lower respiratory infections, which include various pneumonias, र diarrheal diseases are caused by many different viruses, bacteria or parasites.

Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles र tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory र diarrheal deaths.

Tropical diseases include Chagas रोग, dengue fever, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis र trypanosomiasis.

A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a रोग that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

In some cases, a microorganism र its host live in reasonable harmony. Such is the case for many tropical viruses र the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived र reproduced for thousands or millions of years. Because the microbes र their hosts have co-evolved together, the hosts have gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. But when a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease being a harmless parasite and—simply because it is new to the human species—become a pathogen. (See infection).

With most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new ecological niche. Once that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins causing human रोग.

Several human activities have led to the emergence र spread of new diseases:

The relationship between virulence र transmission is complex, र has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. If a रोग is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhoea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing, coughing etc create infectious aerosols). Since it takes time for a microbe र a new host species to co-evolve an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new रोग that death rates are highest.

Nephrology is the branch of internal medicine dealing with the study of the function and diseases of the kidney. The word "nephrology" is derived from the Greek word "nephros", which means "kidney", and the suffix "-ology", or "study of".

Most diseases affecting the kidney are not limited to the organ itself, but are systemic disorders. Nephrology concerns itself with the diagnosis of kidney disease and its treatment (medication, dialysis), and follow-up of renal transplant patients. Additionally, most nephrologists consider themselves to be expert in the care of electrolyte disorders and hypertension. Given that most renal conditions are chronic, nephrologists "grow with their patients".

Patients are referred to nephrology specialists for various different reasons, such as :

Urologists are surgical specialists of the urinary tract. They are involved in renal diseases that might be amenable to surgery:

As with the rest of medicine, important clues as to the cause of any symptom are gained in the history and physical examination.

Laboratory tests are almost always aimed at: urea, creatinine, electrolytes, and urinalysis-- which is frequently the key test in suggesting a diagnosis. 

More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain systemic diseases to kidney failure such as hepatitis b or hepatitis c, lupus serologies, paraproteinemias such as amyloidosis or multiple myeloma or various other systemic diseases that lead to kidney failure. Collection of a 24-hour sample of urine can give valuable information on the filtering capacity of the kidney and the amount of protein loss in some forms of kidney disease. However, 24-hour urine samples have recently, in the setting of chronic renal disease, been replaced by spot urine ratio of protein and creatinine. 

Other tests often performed by nephrologists are:

Many kidney diseases are treated with medication, such as steroids, DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), antihypertensives (many kidney diseases feature hypertension). Often erythropoietin and vitamin D treatment is required to replace these two hormones, the production of which stagnates in chronic renal disease.

When symptoms of renal failure become too severe, dialysis might be required. "Please refer to dialysis for a comprehensive account of this treatment."

If patients proceed to renal transplant, nephrologist often monitor the immunosuppressive regimen and the infections that can occur at this stage.

However, 24-hour urine samples have recently, in the setting of chronic renal disease, been replaced by spot urine ratio of protein र creatinine. 

Other tests often performed by nephrologists are:

Many kidney diseases are treated with medication, such as steroids, DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), antihypertensives (many kidney diseases feature hypertension). Often erythropoietin र vitamin D treatment is required to replace these two hormones, the production of which stagnates in chronic renal disease.

When symptoms of renal failure become too severe, dialysis might be required. "Please refer to dialysis for a comprehensive account of this treatment."

If patients proceed to renal transplant, nephrologist often monitor the immunosuppressive regimen र the infections that can occur at this stage.


Nephrology is the branch of internal medicine dealing with the study of the function र diseases of the kidney. The word "nephrology" is derived from the Greek word "nephros", which means "kidney", र the suffix "-ology", or "study of".

Most diseases affecting the kidney are not limited to the organ itself, but are systemic disorders. Nephrology concerns itself with the diagnosis of kidney disease र its treatment (medication, dialysis), र follow-up of renal transplant patients. Additionally, most nephrologists consider themselves to be expert in the care of electrolyte disorders र hypertension. Given that most renal conditions are chronic, nephrologists "grow with their patients".

Patients are referred to nephrology specialists for various different reasons, such as :

Urologists are surgical specialists of the urinary tract. They are involved in renal diseases that might be amenable to surgery:

As with the rest of medicine, important clues as to the cause of any symptom are gained in the history र physical examination.

Laboratory tests are almost always aimed at: urea, creatinine, electrolytes, र urinalysis-- which is frequently the key test in suggesting a diagnosis.

Often erythropoietin र vitamin D treatment is required to replace these two hormones, the production of which stagnates in chronic renal disease.

When symptoms of renal failure become too severe, dialysis might be required. "Please refer to dialysis for a comprehensive account of this treatment."

If patients proceed to renal transplant, nephrologist often monitor the immunosuppressive regimen र the infections that can occur at this stage.


Nephrology is the branch of internal medicine dealing with the study of the function र diseases of the kidney. The word "nephrology" is derived from the Greek word "nephros", which means "kidney", र the suffix "-ology", or "study of".

Most diseases affecting the kidney are not limited to the organ itself, but are systemic disorders. Nephrology concerns itself with the diagnosis of kidney disease र its treatment (medication, dialysis), र follow-up of renal transplant patients. Additionally, most nephrologists consider themselves to be expert in the care of electrolyte disorders र hypertension. Given that most renal conditions are chronic, nephrologists "grow with their patients".

Patients are referred to nephrology specialists for various different reasons, such as :

Urologists are surgical specialists of the urinary tract. They are involved in renal diseases that might be amenable to surgery:

As with the rest of medicine, important clues as to the cause of any symptom are gained in the history र physical examination.

Laboratory tests are almost always aimed at: urea, creatinine, electrolytes, र urinalysis-- which is frequently the key test in suggesting a diagnosis. 

More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain systemic diseases to kidney failure such as hepatitis b or hepatitis c, lupus serologies, paraproteinemias such as amyloidosis or multiple myeloma or various other systemic diseases that lead to kidney failure. Collection of a 24-hour sample of urine can give valuable information on the filtering capacity of the kidney र the amount of protein loss in some forms of kidney disease. However, 24-hour urine samples have recently, in the setting of chronic renal disease, been replaced by spot urine ratio of protein र creatinine.
