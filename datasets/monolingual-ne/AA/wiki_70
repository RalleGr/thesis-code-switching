Oncology is the medical subspecialty dealing with the study and treatment of cancer. A physician who practices oncology is an "oncologist". The term originates from the Greek "onkos" (ογκος), meaning bulk, mass, or tumor and the suffix "-ology", meaning "study of."

Oncologists may be divided on the basis of the type of treatment provided.

Oncologists may also be categorized on the basis of the patient type.

Oncology is concerned with:

The oncologist often coordinates the multidisciplinary care of cancer patients, which may involve physiotherapy, counselling, clincal genetics, to name but a few. On the other hand, the oncologist often has to liaise with pathologists on the exact biological nature of the tumor that is being treated.

The most important diagnostic tool remains the medical history: the character of the complaints and any specific symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, unexplained anemia, paraneoplastic phenomena and other signs). Often a physical examination will reveal the location of a malignancy.

Diagnostic methods include:

Apart from in diagnosis, these modalities (especially imaging by CT scanning) are often used to determine operability, i.e. whether it is surgically possible to remove a tumor in its entirety.

Generally, a ""tissue diagnosis"" (from a biopsy) is considered essential for the proper identification of cancer. When this is not possible, "empirical therapy" (without an exact diagnosis) may be given, based on the available evidence (e.g. history, x-rays and scans.)

Occasionally, a metastatic lump or pathological lymph node is found (typically in the neck) for which a primary tumor cannot be found. This situation is referred to as " carcinoma of unknown primary", and again, treatment is empirical, based on past experience of the most likely origin.

It depends completely on the nature of the tumor identified what kind of therapeutical intervention will be necessary. Certain disorders will require immediate admission and chemotherapy (such as ALL or AML), while others will be followed up with regular physical examination and blood tests.

Often, surgery is attempted to remove a tumor entirely. This is only feasible when there is some degree of certainty that the tumor can in fact be removed. When it is certain that parts will remain, curative surgery is often impossible, e.g. when there are metastases elsewhere, or when the tumor has invaded a structure that cannot be operated upon without risking the patient's life. Occasionally surgery can improve survival even if not all tumour tissue has been removed; the procedure is referred to as "debulking" (i.e. reducing the overall amount of tumour tissue). Surgery is also used for the palliative treatment of some of cancers, e.g. to relieve biliary obstruction, or to relieve the problems associated with some cerebral tumours. The risks of surgery must be weighed up against the benefits.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are used as a first-line radical therapy in a number of malignancies. They are also used for adjuvant therapy, i.e. when the macroscopic tumor has already been completely removed surgically but there is a reasonable statistical risk that it will recur. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are commonly used for palliation, where disease is clearly incurable: in this situation the aim is to improve and prolong quality of life. 

Hormone manipulation is well established, particularly in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer. 

There is currently a rapid expansion in the use of monoclonal antibody treatments, notably for lymphoma (Rituximab), and breast cancer (Trastuzumab).

Vaccine and other immunotherapies are the subject of intensive research.

The application of ultrasound in the form of HIFU to solid tumors is under investigation.

A large segment of the oncologist's workload is the following-up of cancer patients who have been successfully treated. For some cancers, early identification of recurrence, with prompt treatment, can lead to better survival and quality of life. It depends on the nature of the cancer whether the follow-up lasts a number of years or remains "life long".

Although 50% of all cancer cases diagnosed achieve curation, a large number of cancer patients will die from the disease. There may be ongoing issues with symptom control associated with progressive cancer. These problems may include pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, immobility, and depression. Not all issues are strictly physical: personal dignity may be affected. Moral and
spiritual issues are also important.

Whilst many of these problems fall within the remit of the oncologist, palliative care has matured into a separate, closely allied speciality to address the problems associated with advanced disease. Palliative care is an essential part of the multidisciplinary cancer care team. Palliative care services may be less hospital-based than oncology, with nurses and doctors who are able to visit the patient at home.

There are a number of recurring "ethical questions" and "dilemmas" in oncological practice.
These include:


These issues are closely related to the patients' personality, religion, culture, personal, and family life. The answers are rarely black and white. It requires a degree of sensitivity and very good communication on the part of the oncology team to address these problems properly.

There is a tremendous amount of research being conducted on all frontiers of oncology, ranging from cancer cell biology to chemotherapy treatment regimens and optimal palliative care and pain relief. This makes oncology an exciting and continuously changing field.

Therapeutic trials often involve patients from many different hospitals in a particular region. In the UK, patients are often enrolled in large studies coordinated by the Medical Research Council (MRC, www.mrc.ac.uk) or the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC, www.eortc.be).

Many cancer patients seek extra help from complementary and alternative therapies, which fall outside of conventional medicine. Some complementary therapies do not have a firm scientific or evidence base. Some patients undoubtedly find complementary therapies helpful whilst they are undergoing conventional treatment.

Whilst most complementary therapies are harmless and even beneficial, they can be expensive. They may also be positively harmful if the patient forgoes conventional treatment altogether, in order to follow alternative regimens. Some alternative regimens are undoubtedly hazardous.

Many cancer patients seek extra help from complementary र alternative therapies, which fall वाहिर of conventional medicine. Some complementary therapies do not have a firm scientific or evidence base. Some patients undoubtedly find complementary therapies helpful whilst they are undergoing conventional treatment.

Whilst most complementary therapies are harmless र even beneficial, they can be expensive. They may also be positively harmful if the patient forgoes conventional treatment altogether, in order to follow alternative regimens. Some alternative regimens are undoubtedly hazardous.




Oncology is the medical subspecialty dealing with the study र treatment of cancer. A physician who practices oncology is an "oncologist". The term originates from the Greek "onkos" (ογκος), meaning bulk, mass, or tumor र the suffix "-ology", meaning "study of."

Oncologists may be divided on the basis of the type of treatment provided.

Oncologists may also be categorized on the basis of the patient type.

Oncology is concerned with:

The oncologist often coordinates the multidisciplinary care of cancer patients, which may involve physiotherapy, counselling, clinical genetics, to name but a few. On the other hand, the oncologist often has to liaise with pathologists on the exact biological nature of the tumor that is being treated.

The most important diagnostic tool remains the medical history: the character of the complaints र any specific symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, unexplained anemia, paraneoplastic phenomena र other signs). Often a physical examination will reveal the location of a malignancy.

Diagnostic methods include:

Apart from in diagnosis, these modalities (especially imaging by CT scanning) are often used to determine operability, i.e. whether it is surgically possible to remove a tumor in its entirety.

Generally, a ""tissue diagnosis"" (from a biopsy) is considered essential for the proper identification of cancer. When this is not possible, "empirical therapy" (without an exact diagnosis) may be given, based on the available evidence (e.g. history, x-rays र scans.)

Occasionally, a metastatic lump or pathological lymph node is found (typically in the neck) for which a primary tumor cannot be found. This situation is referred to as " carcinoma of unknown primary", र again, treatment is empirical, based on past experience of the most likely origin.

It depends completely on the nature of the tumor identified what kind of therapeutical intervention will be necessary. Certain disorders will require immediate admission र chemotherapy (such as ALL or AML), while others will be followed up with regular physical examination र blood tests.

Often, surgery is attempted to remove a tumor entirely. This is only feasible when there is some degree of certainty that the tumor can in fact be removed. When it is certain that parts will remain, curative surgery is often impossible, e.g. when there are metastases elsewhere, or when the tumor has invaded a structure that cannot be operated upon without risking the patient's life. Occasionally surgery can improve survival even if not all tumour tissue has been removed; the procedure is referred to as "debulking" (i.e. reducing the overall amount of tumour tissue). Surgery is also used for the palliative treatment of some of cancers, e.g. to relieve biliary obstruction, or to relieve the problems associated with some cerebral tumours. The risks of surgery must be weighed up against the benefits.

Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are used as a first-line radical therapy in a number of malignancies. They are also used for adjuvant therapy, i.e. when the macroscopic tumor has already been completely removed surgically but there is a reasonable statistical risk that it will recur. Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are commonly used for palliation, where disease is clearly incurable: in this situation the aim is to improve र prolong quality of life. 

Hormone manipulation is well established, particularly in the treatment of breast र prostate cancer. 

There is currently a rapid expansion in the use of monoclonal antibody treatments, notably for lymphoma (Rituximab), र breast cancer (Trastuzumab).

Vaccine र other immunotherapies are the subject of intensive research.

The application of ultrasound in the form of HIFU to solid tumors is under investigation.

A large segment of the oncologist's workload is the following-up of cancer patients who have been successfully treated. For some cancers, early identification of recurrence, with prompt treatment, can lead to better survival र quality of life. It depends on the nature of the cancer whether the follow-up lasts a number of years or remains "life long".

Although 50% of all cancer cases diagnosed achieve curation, a large number of cancer patients will die from the disease. There may be ongoing issues with symptom control associated with progressive cancer. These problems may include pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, immobility, र depression. Not all issues are strictly physical: personal dignity may be affected. Moral and
spiritual issues are also important.

Whilst many of these problems fall within the remit of the oncologist, palliative care has matured into a separate, closely allied speciality to address the problems associated with advanced disease. Palliative care is an essential part of the multidisciplinary cancer care team. Palliative care services may be less hospital-based than oncology, with nurses र doctors who are able to visit the patient at home.

There are a number of recurring "ethical questions" र "dilemmas" in oncological practice.

Many cancer patients seek extra help from complementary र alternative therapies, which fall वाहिर of conventional medicine. Some complementary therapies do not have a firm scientific or evidence base. Some patients undoubtedly find complementary therapies helpful whilst they are undergoing conventional treatment.

Whilst most complementary therapies are harmless र even beneficial, they can be expensive. They may also be positively harmful if the patient forgoes conventional treatment altogether, in order to follow alternative regimens. Some alternative regimens are undoubtedly hazardous.




Oncology is the medical subspecialty dealing with the study र treatment of cancer. A physician who practices oncology is an "oncologist". The term originates from the Greek "onkos" (ογκος), meaning bulk, mass, or tumor र the suffix "-ology", meaning "study of."

Oncologists may be divided on the basis of the type of treatment provided.

Oncologists may also be categorized on the basis of the patient type.

Oncology is concerned with:

The oncologist often coordinates the multidisciplinary care of cancer patients, which may involve physiotherapy, counselling, clinical genetics, to name but a few. On the other hand, the oncologist often has to liaise with pathologists on the exact biological nature of the tumor that is being treated.

The most important diagnostic tool remains the medical history: the character of the complaints र any specific symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, unexplained anemia, paraneoplastic phenomena र other signs). Often a physical examination will reveal the location of a malignancy.

Diagnostic methods include:

Apart from in diagnosis, these modalities (especially imaging by CT scanning) are often used to determine operability, i.e. whether it is surgically possible to remove a tumor in its entirety.

Generally, a ""tissue diagnosis"" (from a biopsy) is considered essential for the proper identification of cancer. When this is not possible, "empirical therapy" (without an exact diagnosis) may be given, based on the available evidence (e.g. history, x-rays र scans.)

Occasionally, a metastatic lump or pathological lymph node is found (typically in the neck) for which a primary tumor cannot be found. This situation is referred to as " carcinoma of unknown primary", र again, treatment is empirical, based on past experience of the most likely origin.

It depends completely on the nature of the tumor identified what kind of therapeutical intervention will be necessary. Certain disorders will require immediate admission र chemotherapy (such as ALL or AML), while others will be followed up with regular physical examination र blood tests.

Often, surgery is attempted to remove a tumor entirely. This is only feasible when there is some degree of certainty that the tumor can in fact be removed. When it is certain that parts will remain, curative surgery is often impossible, e.g. when there are metastases elsewhere, or when the tumor has invaded a structure that cannot be operated upon without risking the patient's life. Occasionally surgery can improve survival even if not all tumour tissue has been removed; the procedure is referred to as "debulking" (i.e. reducing the overall amount of tumour tissue). Surgery is also used for the palliative treatment of some of cancers, e.g. to relieve biliary obstruction, or to relieve the problems associated with some cerebral tumours. The risks of surgery must be weighed up against the benefits.

Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are used as a first-line radical therapy in a number of malignancies. They are also used for adjuvant therapy, i.e. when the macroscopic tumor has already been completely removed surgically but there is a reasonable statistical risk that it will recur. Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are commonly used for palliation, where disease is clearly incurable: in this situation the aim is to improve र prolong quality of life. 

Hormone manipulation is well established, particularly in the treatment of breast र prostate cancer. 

There is currently a rapid expansion in the use of monoclonal antibody treatments, notably for lymphoma (Rituximab), र breast cancer (Trastuzumab).

Vaccine र other immunotherapies are the subject of intensive research.

The application of ultrasound in the form of HIFU to solid tumors is under investigation.

A large segment of the oncologist's workload is the following-up of cancer patients who have been successfully treated. For some cancers, early identification of recurrence, with prompt treatment, can lead to better survival र quality of life. It depends on the nature of the cancer whether the follow-up lasts a number of years or remains "life long".

Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are commonly used for palliation, where disease is clearly incurable: in this situation the aim is to improve र prolong quality of life. 

Hormone manipulation is well established, particularly in the treatment of breast र prostate cancer. 

There is currently a rapid expansion in the use of monoclonal antibody treatments, notably for lymphoma (Rituximab), र breast cancer (Trastuzumab).

Vaccine र other immunotherapies are the subject of intensive research.

The application of ultrasound in the form of HIFU to solid tumors is under investigation.

A large segment of the oncologist's workload is the following-up of cancer patients who have been successfully treated. For some cancers, early identification of recurrence, with prompt treatment, can lead to better survival र quality of life. It depends on the nature of the cancer whether the follow-up lasts a number of years or remains "life long".

Although 50% of all cancer cases diagnosed achieve curation, a large number of cancer patients will die from the disease. There may be ongoing issues with symptom control associated with progressive cancer. These problems may include pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, immobility, र depression. Not all issues are strictly physical: personal dignity may be affected. Moral and
spiritual issues are also important.

Whilst many of these problems fall within the remit of the oncologist, palliative care has matured into a separate, closely allied speciality to address the problems associated with advanced disease. Palliative care is an essential part of the multidisciplinary cancer care team. Palliative care services may be less hospital-based than oncology, with nurses र doctors who are able to visit the patient at home.

There are a number of recurring "ethical questions" र "dilemmas" in oncological practice.
These include:


These issues are closely related to the patients' personality, religion, culture, personal, र family life. The answers are rarely black र white. It requires a degree of sensitivity र very good communication on the part of the oncology team to address these problems properly.

There is a tremendous amount of research being conducted on all frontiers of oncology, ranging from cancer cell biology to chemotherapy treatment regimens र optimal palliative care र pain relief. This makes oncology an exciting र continuously changing field.

Therapeutic trials often involve patients from many different hospitals in a particular region.

Many cancer patients seek extra help from complementary र alternative therapies, which fall वाहिर of conventional medicine. Some complementary therapies do not have a firm scientific or evidence base. Some patients undoubtedly find complementary therapies helpful whilst they are undergoing conventional treatment.

Whilst most complementary therapies are harmless र even beneficial, they can be expensive. They may also be positively harmful if the patient forgoes conventional treatment altogether, in order to follow alternative regimens. Some alternative regimens are undoubtedly hazardous.




Oncology is the medical subspecialty dealing with the study र treatment of cancer. A physician who practices oncology is an "oncologist". The term originates from the Greek "onkos" (ογκος), meaning bulk, mass, or tumor र the suffix "-ology", meaning "study of."

Oncologists may be divided on the basis of the type of treatment provided.

Oncologists may also be categorized on the basis of the patient type.

Oncology is concerned with:

The oncologist often coordinates the multidisciplinary care of cancer patients, which may involve physiotherapy, counselling, clinical genetics, to name but a few. On the other hand, the oncologist often has to liaise with pathologists on the exact biological nature of the tumor that is being treated.

The most important diagnostic tool remains the medical history: the character of the complaints र any specific symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, unexplained anemia, paraneoplastic phenomena र other signs). Often a physical examination will reveal the location of a malignancy.

Diagnostic methods include:

Apart from in diagnosis, these modalities (especially imaging by CT scanning) are often used to determine operability, i.e. whether it is surgically possible to remove a tumor in its entirety.

Generally, a ""tissue diagnosis"" (from a biopsy) is considered essential for the proper identification of cancer. When this is not possible, "empirical therapy" (without an exact diagnosis) may be given, based on the available evidence (e.g. history, x-rays र scans.)

Occasionally, a metastatic lump or pathological lymph node is found (typically in the neck) for which a primary tumor cannot be found. This situation is referred to as " carcinoma of unknown primary", र again, treatment is empirical, based on past experience of the most likely origin.

It depends completely on the nature of the tumor identified what kind of therapeutical intervention will be necessary. Certain disorders will require immediate admission र chemotherapy (such as ALL or AML), while others will be followed up with regular physical examination र blood tests.

Often, surgery is attempted to remove a tumor entirely. This is only feasible when there is some degree of certainty that the tumor can in fact be removed. When it is certain that parts will remain, curative surgery is often impossible, e.g. when there are metastases elsewhere, or when the tumor has invaded a structure that cannot be operated upon without risking the patient's life. Occasionally surgery can improve survival even if not all tumour tissue has been removed; the procedure is referred to as "debulking" (i.e. reducing the overall amount of tumour tissue). Surgery is also used for the palliative treatment of some of cancers, e.g. to relieve biliary obstruction, or to relieve the problems associated with some cerebral tumours. The risks of surgery must be weighed up against the benefits.

Often, surgery is attempted to remove a tumor entirely. This is only feasible when there is some degree of certainty that the tumor can in fact be removed. When it is certain that parts will remain, curative surgery is often impossible, e.g. when there are metastases elsewhere, or when the tumor has invaded a structure that cannot be operated upon without risking the patient's life. Occasionally surgery can improve survival even if not all tumour tissue has been removed; the procedure is referred to as "debulking" (i.e. reducing the overall amount of tumour tissue). Surgery is also used for the palliative treatment of some of cancers, e.g. to relieve biliary obstruction, or to relieve the problems associated with some cerebral tumours. The risks of surgery must be weighed up against the benefits.

Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are used as a first-line radical therapy in a number of malignancies. They are also used for adjuvant therapy, i.e. when the macroscopic tumor has already been completely removed surgically but there is a reasonable statistical risk that it will recur. Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are commonly used for palliation, where disease is clearly incurable: in this situation the aim is to improve र prolong quality of life. 

Hormone manipulation is well established, particularly in the treatment of breast र prostate cancer. 

There is currently a rapid expansion in the use of monoclonal antibody treatments, notably for lymphoma (Rituximab), र breast cancer (Trastuzumab).

Vaccine र other immunotherapies are the subject of intensive research.

The application of ultrasound in the form of HIFU to solid tumors is under investigation.

A large segment of the oncologist's workload is the following-up of cancer patients who have been successfully treated. For some cancers, early identification of recurrence, with prompt treatment, can lead to better survival र quality of life. It depends on the nature of the cancer whether the follow-up lasts a number of years or remains "life long".

Although 50% of all cancer cases diagnosed achieve curation, a large number of cancer patients will die from the disease. There may be ongoing issues with symptom control associated with progressive cancer. These problems may include pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, immobility, र depression. Not all issues are strictly physical: personal dignity may be affected. Moral and
spiritual issues are also important.

Whilst many of these problems fall within the remit of the oncologist, palliative care has matured into a separate, closely allied speciality to address the problems associated with advanced disease. Palliative care is an essential part of the multidisciplinary cancer care team. Palliative care services may be less hospital-based than oncology, with nurses र doctors who are able to visit the patient at home.

There are a number of recurring "ethical questions" र "dilemmas" in oncological practice.
These include:


These issues are closely related to the patients' personality, religion, culture, personal, र family life. The answers are rarely black र white. It requires a degree of sensitivity र very good communication on the part of the oncology team to address these problems properly.

There is a tremendous amount of research being conducted on all frontiers of oncology, ranging from cancer cell biology to chemotherapy treatment regimens र optimal palliative care र pain relief. This makes oncology an exciting र continuously changing field.

Therapeutic trials often involve patients from many different hospitals in a particular region. In the UK, patients are often enrolled in large studies coordinated by the Medical Research Council (MRC, www.mrc.ac.uk) or the European Organisation for Research र Treatment of Cancer (EORTC, www.eortc.be).

Many cancer patients seek extra help from complementary र alternative therapies, which fall वाहिर of conventional medicine. Some complementary therapies do not have a firm scientific or evidence base. Some patients undoubtedly find complementary therapies helpful whilst they are undergoing conventional treatment.

Whilst most complementary therapies are harmless र even beneficial, they can be expensive. They may also be positively harmful if the patient forgoes conventional treatment altogether, in order to follow alternative regimens. Some alternative regimens are undoubtedly hazardous.




Oncology is the medical subspecialty dealing with the study र treatment of cancer. A physician who practices oncology is an "oncologist". The term originates from the Greek "onkos" (ογκος), meaning bulk, mass, or tumor र the suffix "-ology", meaning "study of."

Oncologists may be divided on the basis of the type of treatment provided.

Oncologists may also be categorized on the basis of the patient type.

Oncology is concerned with:

The oncologist often coordinates the multidisciplinary care of cancer patients, which may involve physiotherapy, counselling, clinical genetics, to name but a few. On the other hand, the oncologist often has to liaise with pathologists on the exact biological nature of the tumor that is being treated.

The most important diagnostic tool remains the medical history: the character of the complaints र any specific symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, unexplained anemia, paraneoplastic phenomena र other signs). Often a physical examination will reveal the location of a malignancy.

Diagnostic methods include:

Apart from in diagnosis, these modalities (especially imaging by CT scanning) are often used to determine operability, i.e. whether it is surgically possible to remove a tumor in its entirety.

Generally, a ""tissue diagnosis"" (from a biopsy) is considered essential for the proper identification of cancer. When this is not possible, "empirical therapy" (without an exact diagnosis) may be given, based on the available evidence (e.g. history, x-rays र scans.)

The most important diagnostic tool remains the medical history: the character of the complaints र any specific symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, unexplained anemia, paraneoplastic phenomena र other signs). Often a physical examination will reveal the location of a malignancy.

Diagnostic methods include:

Apart from in diagnosis, these modalities (especially imaging by CT scanning) are often used to determine operability, i.e. whether it is surgically possible to remove a tumor in its entirety.

Generally, a ""tissue diagnosis"" (from a biopsy) is considered essential for the proper identification of cancer. When this is not possible, "empirical therapy" (without an exact diagnosis) may be given, based on the available evidence (e.g. history, x-rays र scans.)

Occasionally, a metastatic lump or pathological lymph node is found (typically in the neck) for which a primary tumor cannot be found. This situation is referred to as " carcinoma of unknown primary", र again, treatment is empirical, based on past experience of the most likely origin.

It depends completely on the nature of the tumor identified what kind of therapeutical intervention will be necessary. Certain disorders will require immediate admission र chemotherapy (such as ALL or AML), while others will be followed up with regular physical examination र blood tests.

Often, surgery is attempted to remove a tumor entirely. This is only feasible when there is some degree of certainty that the tumor can in fact be removed. When it is certain that parts will remain, curative surgery is often impossible, e.g. when there are metastases elsewhere, or when the tumor has invaded a structure that cannot be operated upon without risking the patient's life. Occasionally surgery can improve survival even if not all tumour tissue has been removed; the procedure is referred to as "debulking" (i.e. reducing the overall amount of tumour tissue). Surgery is also used for the palliative treatment of some of cancers, e.g. to relieve biliary obstruction, or to relieve the problems associated with some cerebral tumours. The risks of surgery must be weighed up against the benefits.

Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are used as a first-line radical therapy in a number of malignancies. They are also used for adjuvant therapy, i.e. when the macroscopic tumor has already been completely removed surgically but there is a reasonable statistical risk that it will recur. Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are commonly used for palliation, where disease is clearly incurable: in this situation the aim is to improve र prolong quality of life. 

Hormone manipulation is well established, particularly in the treatment of breast र prostate cancer. 

There is currently a rapid expansion in the use of monoclonal antibody treatments, notably for lymphoma (Rituximab), र breast cancer (Trastuzumab).

Vaccine र other immunotherapies are the subject of intensive research.

The application of ultrasound in the form of HIFU to solid tumors is under investigation.

A large segment of the oncologist's workload is the following-up of cancer patients who have been successfully treated. For some cancers, early identification of recurrence, with prompt treatment, can lead to better survival र quality of life. It depends on the nature of the cancer whether the follow-up lasts a number of years or remains "life long".

Although 50% of all cancer cases diagnosed achieve curation, a large number of cancer patients will die from the disease. There may be ongoing issues with symptom control associated with progressive cancer. These problems may include pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, immobility, र depression. Not all issues are strictly physical: personal dignity may be affected. Moral and
spiritual issues are also important.

Whilst many of these problems fall within the remit of the oncologist, palliative care has matured into a separate, closely allied speciality to address the problems associated with advanced disease. Palliative care is an essential part of the multidisciplinary cancer care team. Palliative care services may be less hospital-based than oncology, with nurses र doctors who are able to visit the patient at home.

There are a number of recurring "ethical questions" र "dilemmas" in oncological practice.
These include:


These issues are closely related to the patients' personality, religion, culture, personal, र family life. The answers are rarely black र white. It requires a degree of sensitivity र very good communication on the part of the oncology team to address these problems properly.

There is a tremendous amount of research being conducted on all frontiers of oncology, ranging from cancer cell biology to chemotherapy treatment regimens र optimal palliative care र pain relief. This makes oncology an exciting र continuously changing field.

Therapeutic trials often involve patients from many different hospitals in a particular region. In the UK, patients are often enrolled in large studies coordinated by the Medical Research Council (MRC, www.mrc.ac.uk) or the European Organisation for Research र Treatment of Cancer (EORTC, www.eortc.be).

Whilst most complementary therapies are harmless र even beneficial, they can be expensive. They may also be positively harmful if the patient forgoes conventional treatment altogether, in order to follow alternative regimens. Some alternative regimens are undoubtedly hazardous.




Oncology is the medical subspecialty dealing with the study र treatment of cancer. A physician who practices oncology is an "oncologist". The term originates from the Greek "onkos" (ογκος), meaning bulk, mass, or tumor र the suffix "-ology", meaning "study of."

Oncologists may be divided on the basis of the type of treatment provided.

Oncologists may also be categorized on the basis of the patient type.

Oncology is concerned with:

The oncologist often coordinates the multidisciplinary care of cancer patients, which may involve physiotherapy, counselling, clinical genetics, to name but a few. On the other hand, the oncologist often has to liaise with pathologists on the exact biological nature of the tumor that is being treated.

The most important diagnostic tool remains the medical history: the character of the complaints र any specific symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, unexplained anemia, paraneoplastic phenomena र other signs). Often a physical examination will reveal the location of a malignancy.

Diagnostic methods include:

Apart from in diagnosis, these modalities (especially imaging by CT scanning) are often used to determine operability, i.e. whether it is surgically possible to remove a tumor in its entirety.

Generally, a ""tissue diagnosis"" (from a biopsy) is considered essential for the proper identification of cancer. When this is not possible, "empirical therapy" (without an exact diagnosis) may be given, based on the available evidence (e.g. history, x-rays र scans.)

Occasionally, a metastatic lump or pathological lymph node is found (typically in the neck) for which a primary tumor cannot be found. This situation is referred to as " carcinoma of unknown primary", र again, treatment is empirical, based on past experience of the most likely origin.

It depends completely on the nature of the tumor identified what kind of therapeutical intervention will be necessary. Certain disorders will require immediate admission र chemotherapy (such as ALL or AML), while others will be followed up with regular physical examination र blood tests.

Often, surgery is attempted to remove a tumor entirely. This is only feasible when there is some degree of certainty that the tumor can in fact be removed. When it is certain that parts will remain, curative surgery is often impossible, e.g. when there are metastases elsewhere, or when the tumor has invaded a structure that cannot be operated upon without risking the patient's life. Occasionally surgery can improve survival even if not all tumour tissue has been removed; the procedure is referred to as "debulking" (i.e. reducing the overall amount of tumour tissue). Surgery is also used for the palliative treatment of some of cancers, e.g. to relieve biliary obstruction, or to relieve the problems associated with some cerebral tumours. The risks of surgery must be weighed up against the benefits.

Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are used as a first-line radical therapy in a number of malignancies. They are also used for adjuvant therapy, i.e. when the macroscopic tumor has already been completely removed surgically but there is a reasonable statistical risk that it will recur. Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are commonly used for palliation, where disease is clearly incurable: in this situation the aim is to improve र prolong quality of life. 

Hormone manipulation is well established, particularly in the treatment of breast र prostate cancer. 

There is currently a rapid expansion in the use of monoclonal antibody treatments, notably for lymphoma (Rituximab), र breast cancer (Trastuzumab).

Vaccine र other immunotherapies are the subject of intensive research.

The application of ultrasound in the form of HIFU to solid tumors is under investigation.

A large segment of the oncologist's workload is the following-up of cancer patients who have been successfully treated. For some cancers, early identification of recurrence, with prompt treatment, can lead to better survival र quality of life. It depends on the nature of the cancer whether the follow-up lasts a number of years or remains "life long".

Although 50% of all cancer cases diagnosed achieve curation, a large number of cancer patients will die from the disease. There may be ongoing issues with symptom control associated with progressive cancer. These problems may include pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, immobility, र depression. Not all issues are strictly physical: personal dignity may be affected. Moral and
spiritual issues are also important.

Whilst many of these problems fall within the remit of the oncologist, palliative care has matured into a separate, closely allied speciality to address the problems associated with advanced disease. Palliative care is an essential part of the multidisciplinary cancer care team. Palliative care services may be less hospital-based than oncology, with nurses र doctors who are able to visit the patient at home.

There are a number of recurring "ethical questions" र "dilemmas" in oncological practice.
These include:


These issues are closely related to the patients' personality, religion, culture, personal, र family life. The answers are rarely black र white. It requires a degree of sensitivity र very good communication on the part of the oncology team to address these problems properly.

There is a tremendous amount of research being conducted on all frontiers of oncology, ranging from cancer cell biology to chemotherapy treatment regimens र optimal palliative care र pain relief. This makes oncology an exciting र continuously changing field.

Therapeutic trials often involve patients from many different hospitals in a particular region. In the UK, patients are often enrolled in large studies coordinated by the Medical Research Council (MRC, www.mrc.ac.uk) or the European Organisation for Research र Treatment of Cancer (EORTC, www.eortc.be).

These issues are closely related to the patients' personality, religion, culture, personal, र family life. The answers are rarely black र white. It requires a degree of sensitivity र very good communication on the part of the oncology team to address these problems properly.

There is a tremendous amount of research being conducted on all frontiers of oncology, ranging from cancer cell biology to chemotherapy treatment regimens र optimal palliative care र pain relief. This makes oncology an exciting र continuously changing field.

Therapeutic trials often involve patients from many different hospitals in a particular region. In the UK, patients are often enrolled in large studies coordinated by the Medical Research Council (MRC, www.mrc.ac.uk) or the European Organisation for Research र Treatment of Cancer (EORTC, www.eortc.be).

Many cancer patients seek extra help from complementary र alternative therapies, which fall वाहिर of conventional medicine. Some complementary therapies do not have a firm scientific or evidence base. Some patients undoubtedly find complementary therapies helpful whilst they are undergoing conventional treatment.

Whilst most complementary therapies are harmless र even beneficial, they can be expensive. They may also be positively harmful if the patient forgoes conventional treatment altogether, in order to follow alternative regimens. Some alternative regimens are undoubtedly hazardous.




Oncology is the medical subspecialty dealing with the study र treatment of cancer. A physician who practices oncology is an "oncologist". The term originates from the Greek "onkos" (ογκος), meaning bulk, mass, or tumor र the suffix "-ology", meaning "study of."

Oncologists may be divided on the basis of the type of treatment provided.

Oncologists may also be categorized on the basis of the patient type.

Oncology is concerned with:

The oncologist often coordinates the multidisciplinary care of cancer patients, which may involve physiotherapy, counselling, clinical genetics, to name but a few. On the other hand, the oncologist often has to liaise with pathologists on the exact biological nature of the tumor that is being treated.

The most important diagnostic tool remains the medical history: the character of the complaints र any specific symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, unexplained anemia, paraneoplastic phenomena र other signs). Often a physical examination will reveal the location of a malignancy.

Diagnostic methods include:

Apart from in diagnosis, these modalities (especially imaging by CT scanning) are often used to determine operability, i.e. whether it is surgically possible to remove a tumor in its entirety.

Generally, a ""tissue diagnosis"" (from a biopsy) is considered essential for the proper identification of cancer. When this is not possible, "empirical therapy" (without an exact diagnosis) may be given, based on the available evidence (e.g. history, x-rays र scans.)

Occasionally, a metastatic lump or pathological lymph node is found (typically in the neck) for which a primary tumor cannot be found. This situation is referred to as " carcinoma of unknown primary", र again, treatment is empirical, based on past experience of the most likely origin.

It depends completely on the nature of the tumor identified what kind of therapeutical intervention will be necessary. Certain disorders will require immediate admission र chemotherapy (such as ALL or AML), while others will be followed up with regular physical examination र blood tests.

Often, surgery is attempted to remove a tumor entirely. This is only feasible when there is some degree of certainty that the tumor can in fact be removed. When it is certain that parts will remain, curative surgery is often impossible, e.g. when there are metastases elsewhere, or when the tumor has invaded a structure that cannot be operated upon without risking the patient's life. Occasionally surgery can improve survival even if not all tumour tissue has been removed; the procedure is referred to as "debulking" (i.e. reducing the overall amount of tumour tissue). Surgery is also used for the palliative treatment of some of cancers, e.g. to relieve biliary obstruction, or to relieve the problems associated with some cerebral tumours. The risks of surgery must be weighed up against the benefits.

Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are used as a first-line radical therapy in a number of malignancies. They are also used for adjuvant therapy, i.e. when the macroscopic tumor has already been completely removed surgically but there is a reasonable statistical risk that it will recur. Chemotherapy र radiotherapy are commonly used for palliation, where disease is clearly incurable: in this situation the aim is to improve र prolong quality of life. 

Hormone manipulation is well established, particularly in the treatment of breast र prostate cancer. 

There is currently a rapid expansion in the use of monoclonal antibody treatments, notably for lymphoma (Rituximab), र breast cancer (Trastuzumab).

Vaccine र other immunotherapies are the subject of intensive research.

The application of ultrasound in the form of HIFU to solid tumors is under investigation.

A large segment of the oncologist's workload is the following-up of cancer patients who have been successfully treated. For some cancers, early identification of recurrence, with prompt treatment, can lead to better survival र quality of life. It depends on the nature of the cancer whether the follow-up lasts a number of years or remains "life long".

Although 50% of all cancer cases diagnosed achieve curation, a large number of cancer patients will die from the disease. There may be ongoing issues with symptom control associated with progressive cancer. These problems may include pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, immobility, र depression. Not all issues are strictly physical: personal dignity may be affected. Moral and
spiritual issues are also important.

Whilst many of these problems fall within the remit of the oncologist, palliative care has matured into a separate, closely allied speciality to address the problems associated with advanced disease. Palliative care is an essential part of the multidisciplinary cancer care team. Palliative care services may be less hospital-based than oncology, with nurses र doctors who are able to visit the patient at home.

Rheumatology, a subspecialty of internal medicine, is devoted to the diagnosis and therapy of rheumatic diseases. The term originates from the Greek "rheuma", meaning "that which flows as a river or stream" and the suffix "-ology", meaning "the study of". Rheumatologists mainly deal with problems involving the joints and the allied conditions of connective tissue.

Diseases diagnosed or managed by the rheumatologist include:


Apart from an extensive medical history and physical examination, a rheumatologist may apply the following diagnostic methods:

Most rheumatic diseases are treated with analgesics, NSAIDs (anti-inflammatory drugs), steroids (in serious cases), DMARDs ("steroid-sparing" agents), monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab and adalimumab, and the soluble TNF receptor etanercept.

Physiotherapy is vital in the treatment of many rheumatological disorders. Occupational therapy can help patients finding alternative ways for common movements which would otherwise be restricted by their disease.

A large body of recent scientific research treats the background of autoimmune disease, the cause of many rheumatic disorders. Epidemiological studies and medication trials are also conducted.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting and educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), and a variety of topical and injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer and hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician.

Neurosurgery is the surgical discipline focused on treating those central and peripheral nervous system diseases amenable to mechanical intervention.

According to the U.S. Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), 

In the U.S., neurosurgeons undergo a rigorous training program, known as a residency, consisting of 5-7 years of postgraduate study in neurosurgery (following a mandatory one-year surgery internship). After completing their residency training, some neurosurgeons undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships which are typically one or two years in duration. Some examples of subspecialty areas in neurosurgery include cerebrovascular and skull base surgery, epilepsy, functional and stereotactic neurosurgery, neurosurgery trauma, spine surgery, and pediatric neurosurgery. Admission into advanced fellowship training programs is extremely competitive.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, competition is fierce for the senior house officer and specialist registrar posts leading up to a consultant qualification.

Neurosurgical conditions include primarily brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerve disorders.

In the U.S., neurosurgeons undergo a rigorous training program, known as a residency, consisting of 5-7 years of postgraduate study in neurosurgery (following a mandatory one-year surgery internship). After completing their residency training, some neurosurgeons undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships which are typically one or two years in duration. Some examples of subspecialty areas in neurosurgery include cerebrovascular र skull base surgery, epilepsy, functional र stereotactic neurosurgery, neurosurgery trauma, spine surgery, र pediatric neurosurgery. Admission into advanced fellowship training programs is extremely competitive.

Eye surgery, also known as ophthalmic surgery or ocular surgery, is surgery performed on the eye or its adnexa, typically by an ophthalmologist. 

Although the terms "laser eye surgery" and "refractive surgery" are commonly used as if they were interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear), while radial keratotomy is an example of refractive surgery without the use of a laser.

A cataract is an opacification or cloudiness of the eye's crystalline lens due to aging, disease, or trauma that typically prevents light from forming a clear image on the retina. If visual loss is significant, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted, with lost optical power usually replaced with a plastic intraocular lens (IOL). Due to the high prevalence of cataracts, cataract extraction is the most common eye surgery.

Glaucoma is a group of diseases affecting the optic nerve that results in vision loss and is frequently characterized by raised intraocular pressure (IOP). There are many glaucoma surgeries, and variations or combinations of those surgeries, that facilitate the escape of excess aqueous humor from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, and a few that lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous.

Laser trabeculoplasty

A trabeculoplasty is a modification of the trabecular meshwork. Laser trabeculoplasty (LTP) is the application of a laser beam to burn areas of the trabecular meshwork, located near the base of the iris, to increase fluid outflow. LTP is used in the treatment of various open-angle glaucomas. The two types of laser trabeculoplasty are argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). As its name suggests, argon laser trabeculoplasty uses an argon laser to create tiny burns on the trabecular meshwork. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is newer technology that uses a to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork and create less thermal damage than ALT.

Iridotomy

An iridotomy involves making puncture-like openings through the iris without the removal of iris tissue. Performed either with standard surgical instruments or a laser, it is typically used to decrease intraocular pressure in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. A laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is the application of a laser beam to selectively burn a hole through the iris near its base. LPI may be performed with either an argon laser or Nd:YAG laser.

Iridectomy

An iridectomy, also known as a corectomy or surgical iridectomy, involves the removal of a portion of iris tissue. A basal iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue from the far periphery, near the iris root; a peripheral iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue at the periphery; and a sector iridectomy is the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris that extends from the pupil margin to the iris root, leaving a keyhole-shaped pupil.

Filtering procedures: penetrating vs. non-penetrating

Filtering surgeries are the mainstay of surgical treatment to control intraocular pressure. An anterior sclerotomy or sclerostomy is used to gain access to the inner layers of the eye 

Penetrating filtering surgeries are further subdivided into guarded filtering procedures, also known as protected, subscleral, or partial thickness filtering procedures (in which the surgeon sutures a scleral flap over the sclerostomy site ), and full thickness procedures . Trabeculectomy is a guarded filtering procedure that removes of part of the trabecular meshwork. Full thickness procedures include sclerectomy, posterior lip sclerectomy (in which the surgeon completely excises the sclera on the area of the sclerostomy ), trephination, thermal sclerostomy (Scheie procedure), iridenclesis, and sclerostomy (including conventional sclerostomy and enzymatic sclerostomy) .

Non-penetrating filtering surgeries do not penetrate or enter the eye's anterior chamber . There are two types of non-penetrating surgeris: Bleb-forming and viscocanalostomy . Bleb forming procedures include ab externo trabeculectomy and deep sclerectomy. Ab externo trabeculectomy (AET) involves cutting from outside the eye inward to reach Schlemm's canal, the trabecular meshwork, and the anterior chamber. Also known as non-penetrating trabeculectomy (NPT), it is an ab externo (from the outside), major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large and very deep scleral flap. The inner wall of Schlemm's canal is stripped off after surgically exposing the canal . Deep sclerectomy, also known as nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (PDS) or nonpenetrating trabeculectomy is a filtering surgery where the internal wall of Schlemm's canal is excised, allowing subconjunctival filtration without actually entering the anterior chamber ; it is commonly performed with the Aquaflow® collagen wick . Viscocanalostomy is also an ab externo, major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large and very deep scleral flap. In the VC procedure, Schlemm's canal is cannulated and viscoelastic substance injected (which dilates Schlemm's canal and the aqueous collector channels).

Other surgical procedures

Goniotomy and trabeculotomy are similar simple and directed techniques of microsurgical dissection with mechanical disruption of the trabecular meshwork . Gonotomy procedures include surgical goniotomy and laser goniotomy. A surgical goniotomy involves cutting the fibers of the trabecular meshwork to allow aqueous fluid to flow more freely from the eye . Laser goniotomy is also known as goniophotoablation and laser trabecular ablation . In many patients suffering from congenital glaucoma, the cornea is not clear enough to visualize the anterior chamber angle. Although an endoscopic goniotomy, which employs an endoscope to view the anterior chamber angle, may be performed , a trabeculotomy which accesses the angle from the exterior surface of the eye, thereby eliminating the need for a clear cornea, is usually preferred in these instances. A specially designed probe is used to tear through the trabecular meshwork to open it and allow fluid flow .Video

Trabeculopuncture uses a Q switched Nd:YAG laser to punch small holes in the trabecular meshwork with . Goniocurretage is an "ab interno" (from the inside) procedure that used an instrument "to scrape pathologically altered trabecular meshwork off the scleral sulcus" . A surgical cyclodialysis is a rarely used procedure that aims to separate the ciliary body from the sclera to form a communication between the suprachoroidal space and the anterior chamber. A cyclogoniotomy is a surgical procedure for producing a cyclodialysis, in which the ciliary body is cut from its attachment at the scleral spur under gonioscopic control.

Certain cells within the eye's ciliary body produce aqueous humor. A ciliary destructive or cyclodestructive procedure is one that aims to destroy those cells in order to reduce intraocular pressure . Cyclocryotherapy, or cyclocryopexy, uses a freezing probe . Cyclophotocoagulation, also known as transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, ciliary body ablation, cyclophotoablation , and cyclophototherapy , uses a laser. Cyclodiathermy uses heat generated from a high frequency alternating electric current passed through the tissue, while cycloelectrolysis uses the chemical action caused by a low frequency direct current.

Eye surgery, also known as ophthalmic surgery or ocular surgery, is surgery performed on the eye or its adnexa, typically by an ophthalmologist. 

Although the terms "laser eye surgery" and "refractive surgery" are commonly used as if they were interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear), while radial keratotomy is an example of refractive surgery without the use of a laser.

A cataract is an opacification or cloudiness of the eye's crystalline lens due to aging, disease, or trauma that typically prevents light from forming a clear image on the retina. If visual loss is significant, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted, with lost optical power usually replaced with a plastic intraocular lens (IOL). Due to the high prevalence of cataracts, cataract extraction is the most common eye surgery.

Glaucoma is a group of diseases affecting the optic nerve that results in vision loss and is frequently characterized by raised intraocular pressure (IOP). There are many glaucoma surgeries, and variations or combinations of those surgeries, that facilitate the escape of excess aqueous humor from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, and a few that lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous.

Laser trabeculoplasty

A trabeculoplasty is a modification of the trabecular meshwork. Laser trabeculoplasty (LTP) is the application of a laser beam to burn areas of the trabecular meshwork, located near the base of the iris, to increase fluid outflow. LTP is used in the treatment of various open-angle glaucomas. The two types of laser trabeculoplasty are argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). As its name suggests, argon laser trabeculoplasty uses an argon laser to create tiny burns on the trabecular meshwork. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is newer technology that uses a to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork and create less thermal damage than ALT.

Iridotomy

An iridotomy involves making puncture-like openings through the iris without the removal of iris tissue. Performed either with standard surgical instruments or a laser, it is typically used to decrease intraocular pressure in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. A laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is the application of a laser beam to selectively burn a hole through the iris near its base. LPI may be performed with either an argon laser or Nd:YAG laser.

Iridectomy

An iridectomy, also known as a corectomy or surgical iridectomy, involves the removal of a portion of iris tissue. A basal iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue from the far periphery, near the iris root; a peripheral iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue at the periphery; and a sector iridectomy is the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris that extends from the pupil margin to the iris root, leaving a keyhole-shaped pupil.

Filtering procedures: penetrating vs. non-penetrating

Filtering surgeries are the mainstay of surgical treatment to control intraocular pressure. An anterior sclerotomy or sclerostomy is used to gain access to the inner layers of the eye 

Penetrating filtering surgeries are further subdivided into guarded filtering procedures, also known as protected, subscleral, or partial thickness filtering procedures (in which the surgeon sutures a scleral flap over the sclerostomy site ), and full thickness procedures . Trabeculectomy is a guarded filtering procedure that removes of part of the trabecular meshwork. Full thickness procedures include sclerectomy, posterior lip sclerectomy (in which the surgeon completely excises the sclera on the area of the sclerostomy ), trephination, thermal sclerostomy (Scheie procedure), iridenclesis, and sclerostomy (including conventional sclerostomy and enzymatic sclerostomy) .

Non-penetrating filtering surgeries do not penetrate or enter the eye's anterior chamber . There are two types of non-penetrating surgeris: Bleb-forming and viscocanalostomy . Bleb forming procedures include ab externo trabeculectomy and deep sclerectomy. Ab externo trabeculectomy (AET) involves cutting from वाहिर the eye inward to reach Schlemm's canal, the trabecular meshwork, and the anterior chamber. Also known as non-penetrating trabeculectomy (NPT), it is an ab externo (from the outside), major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large and very deep scleral flap. The inner wall of Schlemm's canal is stripped off after surgically exposing the canal . Deep sclerectomy, also known as nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (PDS) or nonpenetrating trabeculectomy is a filtering surgery where the internal wall of Schlemm's canal is excised, allowing subconjunctival filtration without actually entering the anterior chamber ; it is commonly performed with the Aquaflow® collagen wick . Viscocanalostomy is also an ab externo, major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large and very deep scleral flap. In the VC procedure, Schlemm's canal is cannulated and viscoelastic substance injected (which dilates Schlemm's canal and the aqueous collector channels).

Laser trabeculoplasty (LTP) is the application of a laser beam to burn areas of the trabecular meshwork, located near the base of the iris, to increase fluid outflow. LTP is used in the treatment of various open-angle glaucomas. The two types of laser trabeculoplasty are argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) र selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). As its name suggests, argon laser trabeculoplasty uses an argon laser to create tiny burns on the trabecular meshwork. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is newer technology that uses a to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork र create less thermal damage than ALT.

Iridotomy

An iridotomy involves making puncture-like openings through the iris without the removal of iris tissue. Performed either with standard surgical instruments or a laser, it is typically used to decrease intraocular pressure in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. A laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is the application of a laser beam to selectively burn a hole through the iris near its base. LPI may be performed with either an argon laser or Nd:YAG laser.

Iridectomy

An iridectomy, also known as a corectomy or surgical iridectomy, involves the removal of a portion of iris tissue. A basal iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue from the far periphery, near the iris root; a peripheral iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue at the periphery; र a sector iridectomy is the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris that extends from the pupil margin to the iris root, leaving a keyhole-shaped pupil.

Filtering procedures: penetrating vs. non-penetrating

Filtering surgeries are the mainstay of surgical treatment to control intraocular pressure. An anterior sclerotomy or sclerostomy is used to gain access to the inner layers of the eye 

Penetrating filtering surgeries are further subdivided into guarded filtering procedures, also known as protected, subscleral, or partial thickness filtering procedures (in which the surgeon sutures a scleral flap over the sclerostomy site ), र full thickness procedures . Trabeculectomy is a guarded filtering procedure that removes of part of the trabecular meshwork. Full thickness procedures include sclerectomy, posterior lip sclerectomy (in which the surgeon completely excises the sclera on the area of the sclerostomy ), trephination, thermal sclerostomy (Scheie procedure), iridenclesis, र sclerostomy (including conventional sclerostomy र enzymatic sclerostomy) .

Non-penetrating filtering surgeries do not penetrate or enter the eye's anterior chamber . There are two types of non-penetrating surgeris: Bleb-forming र viscocanalostomy . Bleb forming procedures include ab externo trabeculectomy र deep sclerectomy. Ab externo trabeculectomy (AET) involves cutting from वाहिर the eye inward to reach Schlemm's canal, the trabecular meshwork, र the anterior chamber. Also known as non-penetrating trabeculectomy (NPT), it is an ab externo (from the outside), major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large र very deep scleral flap. The inner wall of Schlemm's canal is stripped off after surgically exposing the canal . Deep sclerectomy, also known as nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (PDS) or nonpenetrating trabeculectomy is a filtering surgery where the internal wall of Schlemm's canal is excised, allowing subconjunctival filtration without actually entering the anterior chamber ; it is commonly performed with the Aquaflow® collagen wick . Viscocanalostomy is also an ab externo, major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large र very deep scleral flap. In the VC procedure, Schlemm's canal is cannulated र viscoelastic substance injected (which dilates Schlemm's canal र the aqueous collector channels).

Other surgical procedures

Goniotomy र trabeculotomy are similar simple र directed techniques of microsurgical dissection with mechanical disruption of the trabecular meshwork . Gonotomy procedures include surgical goniotomy र laser goniotomy. A surgical goniotomy involves cutting the fibers of the trabecular meshwork to allow aqueous fluid to flow more freely from the eye . Laser goniotomy is also known as goniophotoablation र laser trabecular ablation . In many patients suffering from congenital glaucoma, the cornea is not clear enough to visualize the anterior chamber angle. Although an endoscopic goniotomy, which employs an endoscope to view the anterior chamber angle, may be performed , a trabeculotomy which accesses the angle from the exterior surface of the eye, thereby eliminating the need for a clear cornea, is usually preferred in these instances. A specially designed probe is used to tear through the trabecular meshwork to open it र allow fluid flow .Video

Tube-shunt surgery or drainage implant surgery involves the placement of a tube or glaucoma valve to facilitate aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber . Trabeculopuncture uses a Q switched Nd:YAG laser to punch small holes in the trabecular meshwork with . Goniocurretage is an "ab interno" (from the inside) procedure that used an instrument "to scrape pathologically altered trabecular meshwork off the scleral sulcus" . A surgical cyclodialysis is a rarely used procedure that aims to separate the ciliary body from the sclera to form a communication between the suprachoroidal space र the anterior chamber. A cyclogoniotomy is a surgical procedure for producing a cyclodialysis, in which the ciliary body is cut from its attachment at the scleral spur under gonioscopic control.

Certain cells within the eye's ciliary body produce aqueous humor. A ciliary destructive or cyclodestructive procedure is one that aims to destroy those cells in order to reduce intraocular pressure . Cyclocryotherapy, or cyclocryopexy, uses a freezing probe . Cyclophotocoagulation, also known as transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, ciliary body ablation, cyclophotoablation , र cyclophototherapy , uses a laser. Cyclodiathermy uses heat generated from a high frequency alternating electric current passed through the tissue, while cycloelectrolysis uses the chemical action caused by a low frequency direct current.

Although the terms "laser eye surgery" र "refractive surgery" are commonly used as if they were interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear), while radial keratotomy is an example of refractive surgery without the use of a laser.

A cataract is an opacification or cloudiness of the eye's crystalline lens due to aging, disease, or trauma that typically prevents light from forming a clear image on the retina. If visual loss is significant, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted, with lost optical power usually replaced with a plastic intraocular lens (IOL). Due to the high prevalence of cataracts, cataract extraction is the most common eye surgery.

Glaucoma is a group of diseases affecting the optic nerve that results in vision loss र is frequently characterized by raised intraocular pressure (IOP). There are many glaucoma surgeries, र variations or combinations of those surgeries, that facilitate the escape of excess aqueous humor from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, र a few that lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous.

Goniotomy र trabeculotomy are similar simple र directed techniques of microsurgical dissection with mechanical disruption of the trabecular meshwork . Gonotomy procedures include surgical goniotomy र laser goniotomy. A surgical goniotomy involves cutting the fibers of the trabecular meshwork to allow aqueous fluid to flow more freely from the eye . Laser goniotomy is also known as goniophotoablation र laser trabecular ablation . In many patients suffering from congenital glaucoma, the cornea is not clear enough to visualize the anterior chamber angle. Although an endoscopic goniotomy, which employs an endoscope to view the anterior chamber angle, may be performed , a trabeculotomy which accesses the angle from the exterior surface of the eye, thereby eliminating the need for a clear cornea, is usually preferred in these instances. A specially designed probe is used to tear through the trabecular meshwork to open it र allow fluid flow .Video

Trabeculopuncture uses a Q switched Nd:YAG laser to punch small holes in the trabecular meshwork with . Goniocurretage is an "ab interno" (from the inside) procedure that used an instrument "to scrape pathologically altered trabecular meshwork off the scleral sulcus" . A surgical cyclodialysis is a rarely used procedure that aims to separate the ciliary body from the sclera to form a communication between the suprachoroidal space र the anterior chamber. A cyclogoniotomy is a surgical procedure for producing a cyclodialysis, in which the ciliary body is cut from its attachment at the scleral spur under gonioscopic control.

Certain cells within the eye's ciliary body produce aqueous humor. A ciliary destructive or cyclodestructive procedure is one that aims to destroy those cells in order to reduce intraocular pressure . Cyclocryotherapy, or cyclocryopexy, uses a freezing probe . Cyclophotocoagulation, also known as transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, ciliary body ablation, cyclophotoablation , र cyclophototherapy , uses a laser. Cyclodiathermy uses heat generated from a high frequency alternating electric current passed through the tissue, while cycloelectrolysis uses the chemical action caused by a low frequency direct current.

Although the terms "laser eye surgery" र "refractive surgery" are commonly used as if they were interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear), while radial keratotomy is an example of refractive surgery without the use of a laser.

A cataract is an opacification or cloudiness of the eye's crystalline lens due to aging, disease, or trauma that typically prevents light from forming a clear image on the retina. If visual loss is significant, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted, with lost optical power usually replaced with a plastic intraocular lens (IOL). Due to the high prevalence of cataracts, cataract extraction is the most common eye surgery.

Glaucoma is a group of diseases affecting the optic nerve that results in vision loss र is frequently characterized by raised intraocular pressure (IOP). There are many glaucoma surgeries, र variations or combinations of those surgeries, that facilitate the escape of excess aqueous humor from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, र a few that lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous.

Laser trabeculoplasty

A trabeculoplasty is a modification of the trabecular meshwork. Laser trabeculoplasty (LTP) is the application of a laser beam to burn areas of the trabecular meshwork, located near the base of the iris, to increase fluid outflow. LTP is used in the treatment of various open-angle glaucomas. The two types of laser trabeculoplasty are argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) र selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). As its name suggests, argon laser trabeculoplasty uses an argon laser to create tiny burns on the trabecular meshwork. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is newer technology that uses a to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork र create less thermal damage than ALT.

Iridotomy

An iridotomy involves making puncture-like openings through the iris without the removal of iris tissue. Performed either with standard surgical instruments or a laser, it is typically used to decrease intraocular pressure in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. A laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is the application of a laser beam to selectively burn a hole through the iris near its base. LPI may be performed with either an argon laser or Nd:YAG laser.

Iridectomy

An iridectomy, also known as a corectomy or surgical iridectomy, involves the removal of a portion of iris tissue. A basal iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue from the far periphery, near the iris root; a peripheral iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue at the periphery; र a sector iridectomy is the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris that extends from the pupil margin to the iris root, leaving a keyhole-shaped pupil.

Filtering procedures: penetrating vs. non-penetrating

Filtering surgeries are the mainstay of surgical treatment to control intraocular pressure. An anterior sclerotomy or sclerostomy is used to gain access to the inner layers of the eye 

Penetrating filtering surgeries are further subdivided into guarded filtering procedures, also known as protected, subscleral, or partial thickness filtering procedures (in which the surgeon sutures a scleral flap over the sclerostomy site ), र full thickness procedures . Trabeculectomy is a guarded filtering procedure that removes of part of the trabecular meshwork. Full thickness procedures include sclerectomy, posterior lip sclerectomy (in which the surgeon completely excises the sclera on the area of the sclerostomy ), trephination, thermal sclerostomy (Scheie procedure), iridenclesis, र sclerostomy (including conventional sclerostomy र enzymatic sclerostomy) .

Non-penetrating filtering surgeries do not penetrate or enter the eye's anterior chamber . There are two types of non-penetrating surgeris: Bleb-forming र viscocanalostomy . Bleb forming procedures include ab externo trabeculectomy र deep sclerectomy. Ab externo trabeculectomy (AET) involves cutting from वाहिर the eye inward to reach Schlemm's canal, the trabecular meshwork, र the anterior chamber. Also known as non-penetrating trabeculectomy (NPT), it is an ab externo (from the outside), major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large र very deep scleral flap.

Although the terms "laser eye surgery" र "refractive surgery" are commonly used as if they were interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear), while radial keratotomy is an example of refractive surgery without the use of a laser.

A cataract is an opacification or cloudiness of the eye's crystalline lens due to aging, disease, or trauma that typically prevents light from forming a clear image on the retina. If visual loss is significant, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted, with lost optical power usually replaced with a plastic intraocular lens (IOL). Due to the high prevalence of cataracts, cataract extraction is the most common eye surgery.

Glaucoma is a group of diseases affecting the optic nerve that results in vision loss र is frequently characterized by raised intraocular pressure (IOP). There are many glaucoma surgeries, र variations or combinations of those surgeries, that facilitate the escape of excess aqueous humor from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, र a few that lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous.

Laser trabeculoplasty

A trabeculoplasty is a modification of the trabecular meshwork. Laser trabeculoplasty (LTP) is the application of a laser beam to burn areas of the trabecular meshwork, located near the base of the iris, to increase fluid outflow. LTP is used in the treatment of various open-angle glaucomas. The two types of laser trabeculoplasty are argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) र selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). As its name suggests, argon laser trabeculoplasty uses an argon laser to create tiny burns on the trabecular meshwork. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is newer technology that uses a to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork र create less thermal damage than ALT.

Iridotomy

An iridotomy involves making puncture-like openings through the iris without the removal of iris tissue. Performed either with standard surgical instruments or a laser, it is typically used to decrease intraocular pressure in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. A laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is the application of a laser beam to selectively burn a hole through the iris near its base. LPI may be performed with either an argon laser or Nd:YAG laser.

Iridectomy

An iridectomy, also known as a corectomy or surgical iridectomy, involves the removal of a portion of iris tissue. A basal iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue from the far periphery, near the iris root; a peripheral iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue at the periphery; र a sector iridectomy is the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris that extends from the pupil margin to the iris root, leaving a keyhole-shaped pupil.

Filtering procedures: penetrating vs. non-penetrating

Filtering surgeries are the mainstay of surgical treatment to control intraocular pressure. An anterior sclerotomy or sclerostomy is used to gain access to the inner layers of the eye 

Penetrating filtering surgeries are further subdivided into guarded filtering procedures, also known as protected, subscleral, or partial thickness filtering procedures (in which the surgeon sutures a scleral flap over the sclerostomy site ), र full thickness procedures . Trabeculectomy is a guarded filtering procedure that removes of part of the trabecular meshwork. Full thickness procedures include sclerectomy, posterior lip sclerectomy (in which the surgeon completely excises the sclera on the area of the sclerostomy ), trephination, thermal sclerostomy (Scheie procedure), iridenclesis, र sclerostomy (including conventional sclerostomy र enzymatic sclerostomy) .

Non-penetrating filtering surgeries do not penetrate or enter the eye's anterior chamber . There are two types of non-penetrating surgeris: Bleb-forming र viscocanalostomy . Bleb forming procedures include ab externo trabeculectomy र deep sclerectomy . Ab externo trabeculectomy (AET) involves cutting from वाहिर the eye inward to reach Schlemm's canal, the trabecular meshwork, र the anterior chamber. Also known as non-penetrating trabeculectomy (NPT), it is an ab externo (from the outside), major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large र very deep scleral flap. The inner wall of Schlemm's canal is stripped off after surgically exposing the canal . Deep sclerectomy, also known as nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (PDS) or nonpenetrating trabeculectomy is a filtering surgery where the internal wall of Schlemm's canal is excised, allowing subconjunctival filtration without actually entering the anterior chamber ; it is commonly performed with the Aquaflow® collagen wick . Viscocanalostomy is also an ab externo, major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large र very deep scleral flap. In the VC procedure, Schlemm's canal is cannulated र viscoelastic substance injected (which dilates Schlemm's canal र the aqueous collector channels).

Other surgical procedures

Goniotomy र trabeculotomy are similar simple र directed techniques of microsurgical dissection with mechanical disruption of the trabecular meshwork . Gonotomy procedures include surgical goniotomy र laser goniotomy. A surgical goniotomy involves cutting the fibers of the trabecular meshwork to allow aqueous fluid to flow more freely from the eye . Laser goniotomy is also known as goniophotoablation र laser trabecular ablation . In many patients suffering from congenital glaucoma, the cornea is not clear enough to visualize the anterior chamber angle. Although an endoscopic goniotomy, which employs an endoscope to view the anterior chamber angle, may be performed , a trabeculotomy which accesses the angle from the exterior surface of the eye, thereby eliminating the need for a clear cornea, is usually preferred in these instances. A specially designed probe is used to tear through the trabecular meshwork to open it र allow fluid flow .Video

Tube-shunt surgery or drainage implant surgery involves the placement of a tube or glaucoma valve to facilitate aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber . Trabeculopuncture uses a Q switched Nd:YAG laser to punch small holes in the trabecular meshwork with . Goniocurretage is an "ab interno" (from the inside) procedure that used an instrument "to scrape pathologically altered trabecular meshwork off the scleral sulcus" . A surgical cyclodialysis is a rarely used procedure that aims to separate the ciliary body from the sclera to form a communication between the suprachoroidal space र the anterior chamber. A cyclogoniotomy is a surgical procedure for producing a cyclodialysis, in which the ciliary body is cut from its attachment at the scleral spur under gonioscopic control.

Certain cells within the eye's ciliary body produce aqueous humor. A ciliary destructive or cyclodestructive procedure is one that aims to destroy those cells in order to reduce intraocular pressure . Cyclocryotherapy, or cyclocryopexy, uses a freezing probe . Cyclophotocoagulation, also known as transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, ciliary body ablation, cyclophotoablation , र cyclophototherapy , uses a laser. Cyclodiathermy uses heat generated from a high frequency alternating electric current passed through the tissue, while cycloelectrolysis uses the chemical action caused by a low frequency direct current.

A basal iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue from the far periphery, near the iris root; a peripheral iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue at the periphery; र a sector iridectomy is the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris that extends from the pupil margin to the iris root, leaving a keyhole-shaped pupil.

Filtering procedures: penetrating vs. non-penetrating

Filtering surgeries are the mainstay of surgical treatment to control intraocular pressure. An anterior sclerotomy or sclerostomy is used to gain access to the inner layers of the eye 

Penetrating filtering surgeries are further subdivided into guarded filtering procedures, also known as protected, subscleral, or partial thickness filtering procedures (in which the surgeon sutures a scleral flap over the sclerostomy site ), र full thickness procedures . Trabeculectomy is a guarded filtering procedure that removes of part of the trabecular meshwork. Full thickness procedures include sclerectomy, posterior lip sclerectomy (in which the surgeon completely excises the sclera on the area of the sclerostomy ), trephination, thermal sclerostomy (Scheie procedure), iridenclesis, र sclerostomy (including conventional sclerostomy र enzymatic sclerostomy) .

Non-penetrating filtering surgeries do not penetrate or enter the eye's anterior chamber . There are two types of non-penetrating surgeris: Bleb-forming र viscocanalostomy . Bleb forming procedures include ab externo trabeculectomy र deep sclerectomy . Ab externo trabeculectomy (AET) involves cutting from वाहिर the eye inward to reach Schlemm's canal, the trabecular meshwork, र the anterior chamber. Also known as non-penetrating trabeculectomy (NPT), it is an ab externo (from the outside), major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large र very deep scleral flap. The inner wall of Schlemm's canal is stripped off after surgically exposing the canal . Deep sclerectomy, also known as nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (PDS) or nonpenetrating trabeculectomy is a filtering surgery where the internal wall of Schlemm's canal is excised, allowing subconjunctival filtration without actually entering the anterior chamber ; it is commonly performed with the Aquaflow® collagen wick . Viscocanalostomy is also an ab externo, major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large र very deep scleral flap. In the VC procedure, Schlemm's canal is cannulated र viscoelastic substance injected (which dilates Schlemm's canal र the aqueous collector channels).

Other surgical procedures

Goniotomy र trabeculotomy are similar simple र directed techniques of microsurgical dissection with mechanical disruption of the trabecular meshwork . Gonotomy procedures include surgical goniotomy र laser goniotomy. A surgical goniotomy involves cutting the fibers of the trabecular meshwork to allow aqueous fluid to flow more freely from the eye . Laser goniotomy is also known as goniophotoablation र laser trabecular ablation . In many patients suffering from congenital glaucoma, the cornea is not clear enough to visualize the anterior chamber angle. Although an endoscopic goniotomy, which employs an endoscope to view the anterior chamber angle, may be performed , a trabeculotomy which accesses the angle from the exterior surface of the eye, thereby eliminating the need for a clear cornea, is usually preferred in these instances. A specially designed probe is used to tear through the trabecular meshwork to open it र allow fluid flow .Video

Tube-shunt surgery or drainage implant surgery involves the placement of a tube or glaucoma valve to facilitate aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber . Trabeculopuncture uses a Q switched Nd:YAG laser to punch small holes in the trabecular meshwork with . Goniocurretage is an "ab interno" (from the inside) procedure that used an instrument "to scrape pathologically altered trabecular meshwork off the scleral sulcus" . A surgical cyclodialysis is a rarely used procedure that aims to separate the ciliary body from the sclera to form a communication between the suprachoroidal space र the anterior chamber. A cyclogoniotomy is a surgical procedure for producing a cyclodialysis, in which the ciliary body is cut from its attachment at the scleral spur under gonioscopic control.

Certain cells within the eye's ciliary body produce aqueous humor. A ciliary destructive or cyclodestructive procedure is one that aims to destroy those cells in order to reduce intraocular pressure . Cyclocryotherapy, or cyclocryopexy, uses a freezing probe . Cyclophotocoagulation, also known as transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, ciliary body ablation, cyclophotoablation , र cyclophototherapy , uses a laser. Cyclodiathermy uses heat generated from a high frequency alternating electric current passed through the tissue, while cycloelectrolysis uses the chemical action caused by a low frequency direct current.
