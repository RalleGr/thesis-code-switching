पानी

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। It is the most universal solvent.

Water is an abundant substance on Earth. It exists in many places and forms: mostly in the oceans and polar ice caps, but also as clouds, rain water, rivers or freshwaters, and sea ice. On the planet, water is continuously moving through the cycle involving evaporation, precipitation, and runoff to the sea.

All known forms of life need water. Humans consume "drinking water", water with qualities compatible with the human body. This natural resource has become scarce with the growing world population, and its availability is a major social and economic concern.

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। It is the most universal solvent.

पानी प्रिथ्विमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ . It exists in many places and forms: mostly in the oceans and polar ice caps, but also as clouds, rain water, rivers or freshwaters, and sea ice. On the planet, water is continuously moving through the cycle involving evaporation, precipitation, and runoff to the sea.

All known forms of life need water. Humans consume "drinking water", water with qualities compatible with the human body. This natural resource has become scarce with the growing world population, and its availability is a major social and economic concern.

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वब्यापि It is the most universal solvent.

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरिरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठुलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वब्यापि It is the most universal solvent.

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरिरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठुलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam.

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water.

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4°C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4°C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4 °C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4 °C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4 °C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4 °C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4 °C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4 °C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4 °C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4 °C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

Water takes many different shapes on earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, waves and icebergs in the sea, glaciers in the mountain, aquifers in the ground, to name but a few. Through evaporation, precipitation and runoff, water is continuously flowing from one form to another, in what is called the water cycle.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4 °C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4 °C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । 
Because of the importance of precipitation to agriculture, and to mankind in general, we give different names to its various forms: while rain is common in most countries, other phenomena are quite surprising when seen for the first time: hail, snow, fog or dew for example. When appropriately lit, water drops in the air can refract the beautiful colours of a rainbow.

Similarly, water runoffs have played major roles in our history: rivers and irrigation brought the water needed for agriculture. Rivers and the seas offered opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoffs played a major part in shaping our environment providing river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers.

Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs, or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells.

Because water can contain many different substances, it can taste or smell very differently. In fact, we have developed our senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: we avoid the salty seas and the putrid swamps, and we like the fresh pure water of a mountain spring.

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4 °C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4 °C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

Water has many unusual properties that are critical for life: it is a good solvent and has high surface tension. Fresh water has its greatest density at 4°C: it becomes less dense as it freezes or heats up. As a stable, polar molecule prevalent in the atmosphere, it plays an important atmospheric role as an absorber of infrared radiation, crucial in the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Water also has an unusually high specific heat, which plays many roles in regulating global climate.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

Water is a very good solvent and dissolves many types of substances, such as various salts and sugar, and facilitates their chemical interaction, which aids complex metabolisms.

Some substances, however, do not mix well with water, including oils and other hydrophobic substances. Cell membranes, composed of lipids and proteins, take advantage of this property to carefully control interactions between their contents and external chemicals. This is facilitated somewhat by the surface tension of water.

Water drops are stable due to the high surface tension of water. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as glass: the water stays together as drops. This property plays a key role in plant transpiration.

A simple but environmentally important and unique property of water is that its common solid form, ice, floats on the liquid. This solid phase is less dense than liquid water, due to the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases of water ice except ice-XI, the solid form is more dense than the liquid form. Fresh water is most dense at 4 °C, and will sink by convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4 °C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold.

Life on earth has evolved with and fine tuned itself to the important features of water. The existence of abundant liquid, vapor and solid forms of water on Earth has no doubt been an important factor in the abundant colonization of Earth's various environments by life-forms adapted to those varying and often extreme conditions.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm.

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

There are three ways to improve the availability of drinking water: produce it more, distribute it better to the needy, and waste it less.

Drinking water is often collected at spring or extracted from artificial borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water. Other water sources are the rain or the seas. This water however is not adequate for human consumption, and water purification is needed. Popular methods for purifying water are filtering, boiling and distillation. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the market mechanism and free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource, and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and reservoirs.

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस्reverse osmosis प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् Reverse osmosis प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

Reducing waste, i.e. using drinking water only for human consumption, is another option. In some cities, such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

Water is considered a purifier in most religions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. For instance, baptism in Christian churches is done with water. As well, a ritual bath in pure water is done for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. And in Islam, the daily Salah can only be done after Ablution (Wodoo) that is washing parts of the body in clean water. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area.

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

All known forms of life depend on water. Water is a vital part of many metabolic processes within the body. Significant quantities of water are used during the digestion of food. (Note however that some bacteria and plant seeds can enter a cryptobiotic state for an indefinite period when dehydrated, and come back to life when returned to a wet environment)

About seventy two percent of the fat free mass of the human body is made of water. To function properly the body requires between one and seven litres/quarts of water per day to avoid dehydration, the precise amount depending on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people. Water is lost from the body in urine and faeces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath.

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् Reverse osmosis प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले बप्तिस्मा लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

Humans require water that does not contain too much salt or other impurities. Common impurities include chemicals or harmful bacteria. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for perceived taste enhancement. Water that is suitable for drinking is termed potable water.

Because of the growth of world population and other factors, the availability of drinking water per person is shrinking. This issue can be solved through more production, better distribution, or through less waste. 

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् Reverse osmosis प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले बप्तिस्मा लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् Reverse osmosis प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले बप्तिस्मा लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् Reverse osmosis प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले बप्तिस्मा लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् Reverse osmosis प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले बप्तिस्मा लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले बप्तिस्मा लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् Reverse osmosis प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension) हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाब(Surface Tension)धेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले बप्तिस्मा लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई पानीचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।
Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठॉउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पुर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बॉध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाँउ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पुर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सुर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यबस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जिवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका स्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी स्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक स्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी संचयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिईन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रकृयाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषीउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिकृयामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिकृयाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक कृयाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रुपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन् । पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमिनमा पाइन्छ । वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ । सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ । प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासंग जोडिएको छ । खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ । खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ । यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ । पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरु प्रदान गर्दछन् । नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ । नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमिनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ । यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ । बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ । यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ । वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं । हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रुपहरुको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ । यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ । ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ । पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ । पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ । यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ । सजिवहरूको शरिरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरुमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन् । केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन् । प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ । यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ । यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ । ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ । तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरुप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ । पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन ।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ । खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ ।

मानव शरिरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ । शरिरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ । जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ । हाम्रो शरिरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ । साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरु र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन् । पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरिरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन् ।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ । खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर ।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ । जमिन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ । यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन् । यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन । यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ । पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ । त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरुमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ । विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ । तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन् । निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ । हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ । खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरुपयोग हो । प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ । क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन् । क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन् । विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन् ।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रूपहरूको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रूपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रूपहरूको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रूपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रूपहरूको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रूपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



मोटा अक्षर

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रूपहरूको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रूपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

मोटा अक्षर

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रूपहरूको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रूपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रूपहरूको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



मोटा अक्षर

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रूपहरूको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रूपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



मोटा अक्षर

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रूपहरूको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रूपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



मोटा अक्षर

पानी एक रङहिन, स्वादहिन, र गन्दहिन बस्तु हो जुन समस्त ज्ञात जीवन रूपहरूको आधार हो। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफपिण्ड का रूपमा, र वादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै बाफ, झरि र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै ज्ञात प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरसँग मिल्नेखाले खानेपानी खाँदछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुनपुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



मोटा अक्षर

पानी कुनै रङ, स्वाद वा गन्ध नभएको बस्तु हो। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन धान्नको लागि पानी नभई हुँदैन। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफ का रूपमा, अनि बादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, २००३) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next २० years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by ३०%. ४०% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than २.२ million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In २००४, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every १५ seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



मोटा अक्षर यसको अणुशुत्र H2O हो। 

पानी कुनै रङ, स्वाद वा गन्ध नभएको बस्तु हो। त्ससैले पानीलाई स्वादहीन, गन्धहीन यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरुको जीवन धान्नको लागि पानी नभई हुँदैन। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो। यसलाई विज्ञानमा यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ। 

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफ का रूपमा, अनि बादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, २००३) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next २० years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by ३०%. ४०% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than २.२ million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In २००४, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every १५ seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

Water is a strategic resource for many countries. Many battles and wars, such as the Six-Day War in the Middle East, have been fought to gain access to it. Experts predict more trouble ahead because of the world's growing population, increasing contamination through pollution and global warming.

UNESCO's World Water Development Report (WWDR, २००३) from its World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next २० years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by ३०%. ४०% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than २.२ million people died in 2000 from diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In २००४, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every १५ seconds due to easily preventable water-related diseases.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the "next oil", making Canada, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world.

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.

पानी कुनै रङ, स्वाद वा गन्ध नभएको बस्तु हो। त्ससैले पानीलाई स्वादहीन, गन्धहीन यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरुको जीवन धान्नको लागि पानी नभई हुँदैन। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो। यसलाई विज्ञानमा यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरुको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा संकेत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरी बाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरुको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।

प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
Water is often given spiritual powers. In Celtic mythology, Sulis is the local goddess of thermal springs; in Hinduism, the Ganga is also personified as a goddess. Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, river or lakes: for example in Greek and Roman mythology, Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand Oceanids.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher maintained that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire, earth and air, and was regarded as the ylem, or basic stuff of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the four bodily humours, water was associated with phlegm. Water was also one of the Five Elements in traditional Chinese philosophy, along with 
earth,fire, wood, and metal.



मोटा अक्षर यसको अणुशुत्र H2O हो। 

पानी कुनै रङ, स्वाद वा गन्ध नभएको बस्तु हो। त्ससैले पानीलाई स्वादहीन, गन्धहीन यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरुको जीवन धान्नको लागि पानी नभई हुँदैन। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो। यसलाई विज्ञानमा यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ। 

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफ का रूपमा, अनि बादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरुको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा संकेत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरी बाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरुको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।
प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
पानीलाई बिभिन्न धर्ममा आध्यात्मिक शक्तिको प्रतीक मानिएको छ। केल्टिक पौराणिक कथामा सुलिस लाई तातो मूलकी स्थानीय देवीको मान्यता दिइएको छ । हिंदू संस्कृतिमा गंगालाई पनि देवी को रूपमा पूजा गरिन्छ। वैकल्पिक रूपमा, ईश्वरहरू विशेष नदी वा जलहरूको संरक्षक हुन सक्छ: उदाहरणका लागि ग्रीक र रोमन पौराणिक कथा, पीनस तीन हजार मध्ये एक जल परी थिइन् ।
एम्प्रोपल्स, एक ग्रीक दार्शनिकका अनुसार पानी आगो र वायु संगै को पञ्च तत्त्वहरू मध्येको एक तत्व हो । यस सिद्धान्तमा चार शारीरिक शारीरिक हास्य, पानी फुलगम सँग सम्बन्धित थियो। पानी एक पांच तत्व पनि पारंपरिक चीनी दर्शन मा एक थियो ।



मोटा अक्षर यसको अणुशुत्र H2O हो। 

पानी कुनै रङ, स्वाद वा गन्ध नभएको बस्तु हो। त्ससैले पानीलाई स्वादहीन, गन्धहीन यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ । सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरुको जीवन धान्नको लागि पानी नभई हुँदैन। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो। यसलाई विज्ञानमा यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ। 

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो धेरै ठाउँ र धेरै आकारमा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर र ध्रुविय बरफ का रूपमा, अनि बादल, वर्षा, खोला र समुद्रमा। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरुको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा संकेत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरी बाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरुको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।
प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
पानीलाई बिभिन्न धर्ममा आध्यात्मिक शक्तिको प्रतीक मानिएको छ। केल्टिक पौराणिक कथामा सुलिस लाई तातो मूलकी स्थानीय देवीको मान्यता दिइएको छ । हिंदू संस्कृतिमा गंगालाई पनि देवी को रूपमा पूजा गरिन्छ। वैकल्पिक रूपमा, ईश्वरहरू विशेष नदी वा जलहरूको संरक्षक हुन सक्छ: उदाहरणका लागि ग्रीक र रोमन पौराणिक कथा, पीनस तीन हजार मध्ये एक जल परी थिइन् ।
एम्प्रोपल्स, एक ग्रीक दार्शनिकका अनुसार पानी आगो र वायु संगै को पञ्च तत्त्वहरू मध्येको एक तत्व हो । यस सिद्धान्तमा चार शारीरिक शारीरिक हास्य, पानी फुलगम सँग सम्बन्धित थियो। पानी एक पांच तत्व पनि पारंपरिक चीनी दर्शन मा एक थियो ।



मोटा अक्षर यसको अणुशुत्र H२O हो। 
पानी एक रङबिहिन, स्वादबिहिन, वा गन्धबिहिन पदार्थ हो। त्ससैले पानीलाई रङ्गहीन स्वादहीन, गन्धहीन यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ । सम्पूर्ण जीवीत प्राणीहरुको जीवन धान्नको लागि पानी नभई हुँदैन। यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो। यसलाई विज्ञानमा यौगिकको रुपमा लिईन्छ। 

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो बिभिन्न ठाउँमा बिभिन्न अबस्थामा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर, वर्षा खोला र समुद्रमा तरल अवस्थामा, ध्रुवमा र बादलमा बरफ अथवा ठोस अवस्थामा र बाफ तुबालो आदि बाफ अवस्थामा पाइन्छन्। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo.

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरुको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा संकेत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरी बाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरुको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।
प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
पानीलाई बिभिन्न धर्ममा आध्यात्मिक शक्तिको प्रतीक मानिएको छ। केल्टिक पौराणिक कथामा सुलिस लाई तातो मूलकी स्थानीय देवीको मान्यता दिइएको छ । हिंदू संस्कृतिमा गंगालाई पनि देवी को रूपमा पूजा गरिन्छ। वैकल्पिक रूपमा, ईश्वरहरू विशेष नदी वा जलहरूको संरक्षक हुन सक्छ: उदाहरणका लागि ग्रीक र रोमन पौराणिक कथा, पीनस तीन हजार मध्ये एक जल परी थिइन् ।
एम्प्रोपल्स, एक ग्रीक दार्शनिकका अनुसार पानी आगो र वायु संगै को पञ्च तत्त्वहरू मध्येको एक तत्व हो । यस सिद्धान्तमा चार शारीरिक शारीरिक हास्य, पानी फुलगम सँग सम्बन्धित थियो। पानी एक पांच तत्व पनि पारंपरिक चीनी दर्शन मा एक थियो ।



पानी एक रङबिहिन, स्वादबिहिन, वा गन्धबिहिन रसायनिक पदार्थ हो। पानी पृथ्वीको एक मुख्य घटक हो। यसले पृथ्वीको प्रकृतिक धाराहरु, तालहरू, र महासागरहरू, र अधिकांश जीवित जीवहरूको तरल पदार्थ बनेको हुन्छ। यसले कुनै क्यालोरी वा जैविक पोषण प्रदान गर्दैन तरपनि यो सबै ज्ञात प्राणीहरूको जिवनको आधार हो। यसको रासायनिक सूत्र HO हो, अर्थात यसको प्रत्येक अणुमा सहसंयोजक बन्धनहरू द्वारा जोडिएको एक अक्सिजन र दुई हाइड्रोजन परमाणु हुन्छन्। मानक वातावरणीय तापमान र दबावमा HO को तरल अवस्थाको नाम नै पानी हो। बर्षा र कुहिरो पनि पानीले नै बन्छन्। पानीको छरिएका कणहरुले बादल बनेको हुन्छ। पानीको ठोस रुप बरफ हो। बरफको सानो कणले हिउ बनेको हुन्छ । यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो। 

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो बिभिन्न ठाउँमा बिभिन्न अबस्थामा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर, वर्षा खोला र समुद्रमा तरल अवस्थामा, ध्रुवमा र बादलमा बरफ अथवा ठोस अवस्थामा र बाफ तुबालो आदि बाफ अवस्थामा पाइन्छन्। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is perhaps vital to the origin and evolution of life on Earth as we know it. However, if the Earth's location in the solar system was marginally closer or further from the Sun, the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would have been more unlikely.

Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars). According to the solar nebula model of the solar system's formation, Earth's mass may be largely due to its distance from the Sun.

The distance between Earth and the Sun and the combination of solar radiation received and the greenhouse effect of an atmosphere ensures that its surface is neither too cold nor too hot for liquid water. If Earth were more distant, most water would be frozen. If Earth was nearer to the Sun, its higher surface temperature would limit the formation of ice caps, or cause water to exist only as vapor. In the former case, the low albedo of oceans would cause Earth to absorb more solar energy. In the second a runaway greenhouse effect and inhospitable conditions similar to Venus would result.

It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature पृथ्वीको has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying solar flux, indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. See "Gaia hypothesis".

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरुको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा संकेत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरी बाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरुको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।
प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
पानीलाई बिभिन्न धर्ममा आध्यात्मिक शक्तिको प्रतीक मानिएको छ। केल्टिक पौराणिक कथामा सुलिस लाई तातो मूलकी स्थानीय देवीको मान्यता दिइएको छ । हिंदू संस्कृतिमा गंगालाई पनि देवी को रूपमा पूजा गरिन्छ। वैकल्पिक रूपमा, ईश्वरहरू विशेष नदी वा जलहरूको संरक्षक हुन सक्छ: उदाहरणका लागि ग्रीक र रोमन पौराणिक कथा, पीनस तीन हजार मध्ये एक जल परी थिइन् ।
एम्प्रोपल्स, एक ग्रीक दार्शनिकका अनुसार पानी आगो र वायु संगै को पञ्च तत्त्वहरू मध्येको एक तत्व हो । यस सिद्धान्तमा चार शारीरिक शारीरिक हास्य, पानी फुलगम सँग सम्बन्धित थियो। पानी एक पांच तत्व पनि पारंपरिक चीनी दर्शन मा एक थियो ।

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो बिभिन्न ठाउँमा बिभिन्न अबस्थामा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर, वर्षा खोला र समुद्रमा तरल अवस्थामा, ध्रुवमा र बादलमा बरफ अथवा ठोस अवस्थामा र बाफ तुबालो आदि बाफ अवस्थामा पाइन्छन्। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरुको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा संकेत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरी बाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरुको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।
प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
पानीलाई बिभिन्न धर्ममा आध्यात्मिक शक्तिको प्रतीक मानिएको छ। केल्टिक पौराणिक कथामा सुलिस लाई तातो मूलकी स्थानीय देवीको मान्यता दिइएको छ । हिंदू संस्कृतिमा गंगालाई पनि देवी को रूपमा पूजा गरिन्छ। वैकल्पिक रूपमा, ईश्वरहरू विशेष नदी वा जलहरूको संरक्षक हुन सक्छ: उदाहरणका लागि ग्रीक र रोमन पौराणिक कथा, पीनस तीन हजार मध्ये एक जल परी थिइन् ।
एम्प्रोपल्स, एक ग्रीक दार्शनिकका अनुसार पानी आगो र वायु संगै को पञ्च तत्त्वहरू मध्येको एक तत्व हो । यस सिद्धान्तमा चार शारीरिक शारीरिक हास्य, पानी फुलगम सँग सम्बन्धित थियो। पानी एक पांच तत्व पनि पारंपरिक चीनी दर्शन मा एक थियो ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्त्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी बर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्त्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्त्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्त्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्त्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्त्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरुको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा संकेत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरी बाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरुको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रबिधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रबिधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।
प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्त्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
पानीलाई विभिन्न धर्ममा आध्यात्मिक शक्तिको प्रतीक मानिएको छ। केल्टिक पौराणिक कथामा सुलिस लाई तातो मूलकी स्थानीय देवीको मान्यता दिइएको छ । हिंदू संस्कृतिमा गंगालाई पनि देवी को रूपमा पूजा गरिन्छ। वैकल्पिक रूपमा, ईश्वरहरू विशेष नदी वा जलहरूको संरक्षक हुन सक्छ: उदाहरणका लागि ग्रीक र रोमन पौराणिक कथा, पीनस तीन हजार मध्ये एक जल परी थिइन् ।
एम्प्रोपल्स, एक ग्रीक दार्शनिकका अनुसार पानी आगो र वायु संगै को पञ्च तत्त्वहरू मध्येको एक तत्व हो । यस सिद्धान्तमा चार शारीरिक शारीरिक हास्य, पानी फुलगम सँग सम्बन्धित थियो। पानी एक पांच तत्व पनि पारंपरिक चीनी दर्शन मा एक थियो ।



पानी एक रङबिहिन, स्वादबिहिन, वा गन्धबिहिन रसायनिक पदार्थ हो। पानी पृथ्वीको एक मुख्य घटक हो। यसले पृथ्वीको प्रकृतिक धाराहरु, तालहरू, र महासागरहरू, र अधिकांश जीवित जीवहरूको तरल पदार्थ बनेको हुन्छ। यसले कुनै क्यालोरी वा जैविक पोषण प्रदान गर्दैन तरपनि यो सबै ज्ञात प्राणीहरूको जिवनको आधार हो। यसको रासायनिक सूत्र HO हो, अर्थात यसको प्रत्येक अणुमा सहसंयोजक बन्धनहरू द्वारा जोडिएको एक अक्सिजन र दुई हाइड्रोजन परमाणु हुन्छन्। मानक वातावरणीय तापमान र दबावमा HO को तरल अवस्थाको नाम नै पानी हो। बर्षा र कुहिरो पनि पानीले नै बन्छन्। पानीको छरिएका कणहरुले बादल बनेको हुन्छ। पानीको ठोस रुप बरफ हो। बरफको सानो कणले हिउ बनेको हुन्छ । यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो। 

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो विभिन्न ठाउँमा विभिन्न अबस्थामा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर, वर्षा खोला र समुद्रमा तरल अवस्थामा, ध्रुवमा र बादलमा बरफ अथवा ठोस अवस्थामा र बाफ तुबालो आदि बाफ अवस्थामा पाइन्छन्। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

माटोले सोसेर लिएको पानी जमीनमुनी जम्मा हुन्छ। यसरी जम्मा भएको पानी कुनै स्थानबाट मुलफुटेर बाहिर निस्कने गर्दछ। बाहिर निस्केको पानी धारा, कुवा, पधेरा, तातोपानीको फोहोरा आदि नामले चिनिन्छ। यस्तो पानी कृतिम रूपमा ईनार खनेर पनि निकाल्ने गरिन्छ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौं। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्त्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्त्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्त्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्त्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरुको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा संकेत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरीबाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरुको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट संकलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रविधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रविधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।
प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्त्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
पानीलाई विभिन्न धर्ममा आध्यात्मिक शक्तिको प्रतीक मानिएको छ। केल्टिक पौराणिक कथामा सुलिस लाई तातो मूलकी स्थानीय देवीको मान्यता दिइएको छ । हिंदू संस्कृतिमा गंगालाई पनि देवी को रूपमा पूजा गरिन्छ। वैकल्पिक रूपमा, ईश्वरहरू विशेष नदी वा जलहरूको संरक्षक हुन सक्छ: उदाहरणका लागि ग्रीक र रोमन पौराणिक कथा, पीनस तीन हजार मध्ये एक जल परी थिइन् ।
एम्प्रोपल्स, एक ग्रीक दार्शनिकका अनुसार पानी आगो र वायु संगै को पञ्च तत्त्वहरू मध्येको एक तत्व हो । यस सिद्धान्तमा चार शारीरिक शारीरिक हास्य, पानी फुलगम सँग सम्बन्धित थियो। पानी एक पांच तत्व पनि पारंपरिक चीनी दर्शन मा एक थियो ।



पानी एक रङबिहिन, स्वादबिहिन, वा गन्धबिहिन रसायनिक पदार्थ हो। पानी पृथ्वीको एक मुख्य घटक हो। यसले पृथ्वीको प्रकृतिक धाराहरु, तालहरू, र महासागरहरू, र अधिकांश जीवित जीवहरूको तरल पदार्थ बनेको हुन्छ। यसले कुनै क्यालोरी वा जैविक पोषण प्रदान गर्दैन तरपनि यो सबै ज्ञात प्राणीहरूको जिवनको आधार हो। यसको रासायनिक सूत्र HO हो, अर्थात यसको प्रत्येक अणुमा सहसंयोजक बन्धनहरू द्वारा जोडिएको एक अक्सिजन र दुई हाइड्रोजन परमाणु हुन्छन्। मानक वातावरणीय तापमान र दबावमा HO को तरल अवस्थाको नाम नै पानी हो। बर्षा र कुहिरो पनि पानीले नै बन्छन्। पानीको छरिएका कणहरुले बादल बनेको हुन्छ। पानीको ठोस रुप बरफ हो। बरफको सानो कणले हिउ बनेको हुन्छ । यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो। 

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो विभिन्न ठाउँमा विभिन्न अबस्थामा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर, वर्षा खोला र समुद्रमा तरल अवस्थामा, ध्रुवमा र बादलमा बरफ अथवा ठोस अवस्थामा र बाफ तुबालो आदि बाफ अवस्थामा पाइन्छन्। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्त्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूलाई सजिलै घुलाउन सक्छ, त्यसैले पानीको गन्ध र स्वाद विभिन्न स्थानमा फरक फरक हुनेगर्दछ। वास्तवमा हामीले स्वाद र गन्धको आधारमा पानी खान योग्य भएको अथवा नभएको निर्धारण गर्ने गर्दछौँ। हामी समुन्द्रको नुनिलो पानी तथा सिमसारमा जमेको दुर्गन्धित पानी पनि खादैनौ तर पहाडको मुलबाट निस्कने स्वच्छ पानी मनपराएर खान्छौं।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्त्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्त्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्त्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्त्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरुको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा सङ्केत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरीबाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरुको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट सङ्कलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा बर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रविधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रविधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।
प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्त्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
पानीलाई विभिन्न धर्ममा आध्यात्मिक शक्तिको प्रतीक मानिएको छ। केल्टिक पौराणिक कथामा सुलिस लाई तातो मूलकी स्थानीय देवीको मान्यता दिइएको छ । हिंदू संस्कृतिमा गंगालाई पनि देवी को रूपमा पूजा गरिन्छ। वैकल्पिक रूपमा, ईश्वरहरू विशेष नदी वा जलहरूको संरक्षक हुन सक्छ: उदाहरणका लागि ग्रीक र रोमन पौराणिक कथा, पीनस तीन हजार मध्ये एक जल परी थिइन् ।
एम्प्रोपल्स, एक ग्रीक दार्शनिकका अनुसार पानी आगो र वायु संगै को पञ्च तत्त्वहरू मध्येको एक तत्व हो । यस सिद्धान्तमा चार शारीरिक शारीरिक हास्य, पानी फुलगम सँग सम्बन्धित थियो। पानी एक पांच तत्व पनि पारंपरिक चीनी दर्शन मा एक थियो ।



पानी एक रङबिहिन, स्वादबिहिन, वा गन्धबिहिन रसायनिक पदार्थ हो। पानी पृथ्वीको एक मुख्य घटक हो। यसले पृथ्वीको प्रकृतिक धाराहरु, तालहरू, र महासागरहरू, र अधिकांश जीवित जीवहरूको तरल पदार्थ बनेको हुन्छ। यसले कुनै क्यालोरी वा जैविक पोषण प्रदान गर्दैन तरपनि यो सबै ज्ञात प्राणीहरूको जिवनको आधार हो। यसको रासायनिक सूत्र HO हो, अर्थात यसको प्रत्येक अणुमा सहसंयोजक बन्धनहरू द्वारा जोडिएको एक अक्सिजन र दुई हाइड्रोजन परमाणु हुन्छन्। मानक वातावरणीय तापमान र दबावमा HO को तरल अवस्थाको नाम नै पानी हो। वर्षा र कुहिरो पनि पानीले नै बन्छन्। पानीको छरिएका कणहरूले बादल बनेको हुन्छ। पानीको ठोस रुप बरफ हो। बरफको सानो कणले हिउ बनेको हुन्छ । यो सर्वव्यापि घोलक हो। 

पानी पृथ्वीमा धेरै मात्रामा पाइन्छ। यो विभिन्न ठाउँमा विभिन्न अबस्थामा पाइन्छ, मुख्यत: महासागर, वर्षा खोला र समुद्रमा तरल अवस्थामा, ध्रुवमा र बादलमा बरफ अथवा ठोस अवस्थामा र बाफ तुबालो आदि बाफ अवस्थामा पाइन्छन्। यस ग्रहमा पानी सँधै वाफ, झरी र खोलानाला भई समुद्र अनि फेरि बाफको चक्रमा बहिरहन्छ।

सबै प्राणीलाई पानी आवश्यक छ। मानिसहरू शरीरको आवश्यकताअनुसार पानी पिउँछन्। बढ्दो विश्व जनसङ्ख्या सँगै यो प्राकृतिक सम्पदाको अभाव हुन थालेको छ र यसको आपुर्ति एक ठूलो सामाजिक र आर्थिक मुद्दा हुन पुगेको छ।

पृथ्वीमा पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू पाइन्छन्। पानी बादल तथा बाफको रूपमा वायुमण्डलमा; पानी र बरफको रूपमा समुन्द्रमा; हिमताल, हिउ र हिमनदीको रूपमा हिमालमा तथा खुल्ला र मिश्रित रूपमा जमीनमा पाइन्छ। वायुमण्डलमा वास्पिकरण र चिसिने प्रक्रियाका कारण पानीका विभिन्न रूपहरू परिवर्तन भईरहेको हुन्छ साथसाथै पानी एकस्थानबाट अर्को स्थानसम्म पनि पुगिरहेको हुन्छ जसलाई जलचक्र भनिन्छ। सम्पूर्ण मानव जीवनलाई यस चक्रको अती महत्त्व छ। प्रकाशको सही संयोजन हुने हो भने वायुमण्डल भएका पानीका थोपाहरूमा सूर्यको प्रकाश परावर्तन भएमा इन्द्रेणी देखापर्ने गर्दछ।

पानी हाम्रो सभ्यतासँग जोडिएको छ। खेतीपातीको लागि पनि पानी अति आवश्यक छ। खासगरी वर्षाको पानी कृषिउत्पादनका लागि महत्त्वपूर्ण मानिन्छ। यसका अलावा नहर तथा कुलोको मद्दतले नदीको पानी पनि सिंचाईका लागि उपयोग गरिन्छ। पानीका श्रोतहरू नदी र समुन्द्रले यातायात तथा व्यापारका अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्दछन्। नदीहरूले बगाएर ल्याएको माटोले विभिन्न उपत्यका तथा समतल भूभागहरूलाई अत्यन्तै मलिलो बनाउने गर्दछ। नेपालको तराई भूभाग यसको गतिलो उदाहरण हो।

पानीको फरक खालको गुणहुने भएकोले यो प्राणीहरूका लागि अति उपयोगि छ। यो एउटा राम्रो घोलक हो र यसको अति उच्च सतहि दबाब हुन्छ। ४° सेल्सियसमा शुद्ध पानीको घनत्व सबैभन्दा उच्चहुने गर्दछ, ४° सेल्सियस भन्दा तापक्रम बढेपनि घटेपनि यसको घनत्व घट्ने गर्दछ। पानी एउटा तटस्थ पदार्थ भएकोले वातवरणमा विकिरणको शोषण गरी हरित गृह प्रभावलाई समेत घटाउन मद्दत पुर्याउने गर्दछ। पानीको बिशिष्ट तापधारणशक्ति एकदमै धेरै हुने हुनाले यसले पृथ्वीको मौशमलाई निर्धारणगर्न महत्त्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

एउटा राम्रो घोलक पदार्थ भएको हुनाले यसले विभिन्न लवणहरू तथा चिनीलाई घुलाउनेकाम गर्दछ। यसका अलावा पानीले विभिन्न तत्वहरूको रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियामा उत्प्रेरकको रूपमा काम गर्दछ। सजिवहरूको शरीरमाहुने विभिन्न प्रतिक्रियाहरूमा पनि पानीले महत्त्वपूर्ण भूमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ।

यद्यपी केही तत्वहरू पानीमा नघुल्ने खालका हुन्छन्। केही तरल पदार्थ जस्तै तेल, घ्यू र ढुङ्गा, काठ, धातुहरू पानीमा घुल्दैनन्। प्राणी कोषमा हुने सेल मेम्ब्रेन्ले पानीको यही गुणको उपयोग गरी प्राणी कोषभित्र र बाहिरका रासायनिक तत्वहरूको संयोजन गर्ने गर्दछ।

पानीको सतहि दबाबधेरै भएकोले नै पानी थोपाको रूपमा बस्ने गर्दछ। यस्तो उदाहरण शिशा जस्तो कुनै पानी सोस्न नसक्ने वस्तुमा पानी परेको बेलामा देख्न सकिन्छ।
पानीको यो गुण बिरुवाहरूले प्रकाश संस्लेषणको बेलामा उत्पन्न भएको पानीलाई बाहिर फाल्न अति उपयोगि हुन्छ।

पानीको ठोस रूप बरफ तरल पदार्थमा तैरिने गर्दछ। यो साधारण गुण भएपनि यसको वातावरणीय महत्त्व धेरै छ। ठोस अवस्थामा बरफको घनत्व पानीको घनत्व भन्दा कम हुने भएकोले बरफ पानीमा तैरिन्छ। तैरिएको बरफले वातवरणीय चिसोपनालाई तल रहेको पानीसम्म पुग्न दिदैन फलस्वरूप तल्लो सतहको पानी तरल अवस्थामै रहन्छ। पानीको यही अनौठो गुणका कारण धेरै चिसा ठउहरूमा माथिल्लो सतहमा बरफ जमे पनि तल रहेको पानीमा जलचरहरू जीवित रहन सक्छन।

हरेक प्राणीहरूको जीवन पानीले नै धानेको हुन्छ। सम्पूर्ण प्राणीहरूको जीवन प्रक्रियाहरूमा पानीले महत्त्वपूर्ण भुमिका खेल्नेगर्दछ। खानेकुराको पाचन प्रक्रियामा पनि पानीको प्रचुरमात्रा उपयोग हुन्छ।

मानव शरीरको बोसो बाहेकको पिण्ड मध्ये लगभग ७२% पानीले ओगटेको हुन्छ। शरीरले दैनिक कार्यहरू सहजरूपमा गर्न १ लिटर देखि ७ लिटर सम्म पानीको आवश्यकता पर्छ। जलवियोजनबाट बच्न दैनिक क्रियाकलाप, आद्रता, तापक्रम अनुसार फरक मात्रामा पानीको सेवनगर्नु जरुरि हुन्छ। हाम्रो शरीरमा भएको पानी पिशाब, पशिना, दिशा र सास फेर्दा बाफको रूपमा बाहिरजाने गर्दछ।

मानिसलाई पिउनका लागि धेरै लवण नमिसिएको र प्रदुषित नभएको पानी चाहिन्छ। साधारणतया विषालु रसायनहरू र किटाणुहरूले पानीलाई प्रदुषित बनाउछन्। पानीमा घुल्ने केही रसायनहरू शरीरले ग्रहणगर्न सक्छ यस्ता तत्वहरूले पानीको स्वाद बढाउने गर्दछन्।

विश्वको जनसङ्ख्याको वृद्धिसंगै खानेपानीको उपलब्धता पनि घटिरहेको छ। खानेपानीको धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर यसलाई समाधानगर्न सकिन्छ।

पानी धेरै देशहरूको लागि एक रणनीतिक स्रोत हो। मध्य पूर्व मा छ-दिन युद्ध जस्ता धेरै युद्ध तथा लडाईहरूको कारण पानीको अभावनै रहेको छ । संसारको बढ्दो जनसंख्या को कारण विशेषज्ञहरु लाई अधिक समस्या को भविष्यवाणी गरेको छ, प्रदूषण र ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को माध्यमले प्रदूषण बढ्न जान्छ।

[यूनेस्को]] विश्व जल विकास रिपोर्ट २००३ को विश्व जल मूल्यांकन कार्यक्रमबाट यो कुरा सङ्केत गोध्नुभयोो र्दछ कि, अर्को २० वर्षमा, सबैको लागि उपलब्ध पानीको मात्रा ३०% घट्ने अनुमान छ। संसारका ४०% बासिन्दाहरूको हालको न्यूनतम [स्वच्छता]] को लागि अपर्याप्त ताजा पानी छ। सन् २००० मा मात्र पानीजन्य रोग तथा खडेरीबाट २.२ मिलियन भन्दा बढी मानिसहरूको मृत्यु भयो । सन् २००४ मा, युके च्यारिटि वाटरएडले भन्यो कि रोकथाम गर्न मिल्ने पानीजन्य रोगको कारण प्रत्येक १५ सेकेण्डमा एउटा बालकको मृत्यु हुनेगर्दछ । 
केहीले भविष्यवाणी गरेका छन् कि स्वच्छ पानी भएका देशहरू जस्तै क्यानाडा,आइसल्यान्ड , जल स्रोतको साथ, सम्भवतः विश्वको सबैभन्दा धनी देश हुनेछन् ।

खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न निम्न तिन उपायहरू अपनाउन सकिन्छ : धेरै उत्पादन गरेर, आवश्यकता अनुसार सहि वितरण गरेर र खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर।

प्राय जसो खानेपानी पानीका प्राकृतिक मुलहरूबाट सङ्कलन गरिन्छ तर आवश्यकता हेरेर कृतिम रूपमा बोरिङ गरेर तथा ईनार खनेर पनि खानेपानी प्राप्त गरिन्छ। जमीन मुनिको पानीको उपलब्धतालाई हेरेर आवश्यक स्थानहरूमा पर्याप्त ईनारहरू खनेर खानेपानी उत्पादन गर्नसकिन्छ। यसका अलावा वर्षा र समुन्द्रहरू पनि पानीका श्रोतहरू हुन्। यद्यपी यी श्रोतको पानी मानवीय उपभोगको लागि उपयुक्त हुदैन। यस्तो पानीलाई शुद्धिकरण गरेर मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि छान्ने, थिग्र्याउने, उमाल्ने,रासायनिक पदार्थको प्रयोग गरी निर्मलिकरण गर्ने र डिस्टिलेसन प्रविधिहरू अपनाउने गरिन्छ। पानीको शुद्धिकरणका लागि आजभोलि रिभर्स अस्मोसिस् प्रविधि समेत प्रयोगमा ल्याइएकोछ।

खानेपानीको वितरण विभिन्न खानेपानी वितरण आयोजना मार्फत धाराहरू तथा ट्याङ्करहरूबाट गरिन्छ। त्यसका साथै आजभोलि जार तथा बोतलहरूमा भरेर व्यापारिकरूपमा पनि खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गरिएको छ। विश्वका धेरै देशहरूमा सरकारले नै नि:शुल्क खानेपानीको वितरण गर्ने गर्दछ। तर केही विश्लेशकहरू भने निजि संस्थाहरूले यसको सही वितरण तथा व्यवस्थापन गर्ने धारणा राख्ने गर्दछन्। निजि संस्थाहरूले बोरिङ् खन्न, बध तथा पानी सञ्चयगर्ने भण्डार निर्माण गर्न आर्थिक श्रोत उपलब्ध गराउन सक्छन् भन्ने उनीहरूको धारणा छ।

खानेपानीलाई खेरजान नदिएर पनि खानेपानीको उपलब्धतालाई सुधार गर्न सकिन्छ। हङ्कङ् जस्ता केही सहरहरूमा खानेपानी जोगाउन कै लागि पाईखानाको सफाईको लागि समुन्द्रको पानी प्रयोग गरिन्छ। खानेपानीको प्रदुषण पानीको सबैभन्दा ठूलो दुरूपयोग हो। प्रदुषणले पानीको प्रयोगलाई सिमित बनाउछ, मानिसहरू प्रदुषित पानीलाई प्रयोग गर्दैनन् र त्यो पानी खेर जान्छ।
प्राय सबै धर्महरूमा पानीलाई शुद्ध बनाउने वस्तुको रूपमा लिइन्छ। क्रिस्चियन, हिन्दु, मुसलमान, यहुदी र शिख सबैले पानीलाई महत्त्व दिन्छन्। क्रिस्चियन धर्म मान्नेहरूले पानीले लिने गर्दछन् भने मुसलमान, यहुदी र हिन्दुहरूले स्नान गर्न शुद्ध पानीकै प्रयोग गर्छन्। विभिन्न समुदायका मानिसहरूले व्यक्तिगत तथा अन्य सामाग्रिहरूको सरसफाईका लागि पानीको प्रयोग गर्छन्।
पानीलाई विभिन्न धर्ममा आध्यात्मिक शक्तिको प्रतीक मानिएको छ। केल्टिक पौराणिक कथामा सुलिस लाई तातो मूलकी स्थानीय देवीको मान्यता दिइएको छ । हिंदू संस्कृतिमा गंगालाई पनि देवी को रूपमा पूजा गरिन्छ। वैकल्पिक रूपमा, ईश्वरहरू विशेष नदी वा जलहरूको संरक्षक हुन सक्छ: उदाहरणका लागि ग्रीक र रोमन पौराणिक कथा, पीनस तीन हजार मध्ये एक जल परी थिइन् ।
एम्प्रोपल्स, एक ग्रीक दार्शनिकका अनुसार पानी आगो र वायु संगै को पञ्च तत्त्वहरू मध्येको एक तत्व हो । यस सिद्धान्तमा चार शारीरिक शारीरिक हास्य, पानी फुलगम सँग सम्बन्धित थियो। पानी एक पांच तत्व पनि पारंपरिक चीनी दर्शन मा एक थियो ।
