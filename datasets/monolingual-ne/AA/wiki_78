बुद्ध धर्म

Buddhism (also known as "Buddha Dharma" (Pali: Dhamma), "the teachings of the awakened one") is a dharmic, non-theistic religion, a way of life, a practical philosophy, and arguably a form of psychology. Buddhism focuses on the teachings of Gautama Buddha (Pali: Gotama Buddha), who lived on the Indian subcontinent in or around the fifth century BCE Buddhism spread throughout the subcontinent in the five centuries following the Buddha's passing, and propagated into Central, Southeast, and East Asia over the next two millennia.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

The Buddha presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Buddhism (also known as "Buddha Dharma" (Pali: Dhamma), "the teachings of the awakened one") is a dharmic, non-theistic religion, a way of life, a practical philosophy, and arguably a form of psychology. Buddhism focuses on the teachings of Gautama Buddha (Pali: Gotama Buddha), who lived on the Indian subcontinent in or around the fifth century BCE Buddhism spread throughout the subcontinent in the five centuries following the Buddha's passing, and propagated into Central, Southeast, and East Asia over the next two millennia.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

The Buddha presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

The Buddha presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

राजकुमार सिद्धार्थ गौतमले बौद्ध धर्मको सुरूवात गरेका हुन् । उनको जन्म इ.पू.पाचौं शताब्दिमा लुम्बिनिमा भएको थियो र उनको वाल्यकाल कपिलबस्तु दरवारमा बितेको थियो । यी दुबै ठाउँ दक्षिण पश्चिम नेपालमा पर्दछन् । 35 बर्षको उमेरमा बुद्ध ज्ञान प्राप्त गरे पछि उनलाई गौलम बुद्ध भन्न थालियो । त्यस पछिको 45 बर्ष सम्म आफ्नो ज्ञान बाँडेर 80 बर्षको उमेरमा भारतको कुशिनगरमा उनको निधन भयो । उनको मृत्यु पछिको पाँच सय बर्ष सम्म बौद्ध धर्म भारतीय उपमहाद्वीप भरी फैलियो र त्यसपछि एशियाका अन्य भागहरूमा फैलियो ।

सुरूवातमा बुद्ध धर्म एकै रूपको थियो । तर यो ठूलो क्षेत्रमा फैलन थालेपछि क्षेत्र र संस्कृतीका आधारमा मुख्य रूपले तीन रूपमा गर्न सकिन्छ: हिनयान, महायान, बज्रयान ।

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

The Buddha presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

The Buddha presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

The Buddha presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

गौतम बुद्ध presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

गौतम बुद्ध presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

गौतम बुद्ध presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

गौतम बुद्ध presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

गौतम बुद्ध presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

गौतम बुद्ध presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

गौतम बुद्ध presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia . 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111–112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

गौतम बुद्ध presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia . 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111–112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions: Theravāda (Sanskrit: Sthaviravāda), Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide, and it is considered a major world religion. According to one source (), "World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million." However, other sources give approximately 708 million adherents. Buddhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and traditional Chinese religion, respectively. Buddhism is the fourth-largest organised religion in the world, and the monks' order Sangha is amongst the oldest organisations on earth.

When used in a generic sense, a Buddha is generally considered to be a person who discovers the true nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and meditation. This transformational discovery is called bodhi - literally, "Awakening" (more commonly called "Enlightenment"). Any person who has become awakened from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a Buddha. Gautama Buddha is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other Buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to Gautama Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words "Dharma" and putting them into practice, by leading a virtuous, moral life, and purifying the mind.

Concisely put, the aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the stress of existence. "I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering" (The Buddha). To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness is ended, and liberation attained. Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha's teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with 'the wise'. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.

Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of Gautama Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.

The enlightenment (Bodhi) of the Buddha was his liberation from suffering and his insight into the nature of reality. The widely accepted doctrine of dependent origination states that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect. For sentient beings, this amounts to a never-ending cycle of rebirth () according to the law of karma (Pāli: kamma) and vipāka. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anitya, Pāli anicca), they have no real, independent identity (anātman, Pāli anatta) and so do not truly ‘exist’, although to untrained minds they do appear to exist. All phenomena are thus fundamentally insubstantial and empty (śūnya'). Wise human beings, who possess "insight into the knowledge of how things are" (', Sanskrit '), renounce attachment and clinging which cause suffering (, Pāli dukkha), transform the energy of desire into awareness and understanding, and eventually attain .

The Five Aggregates of Attachment are the five ways in which people attach themselves to the world and to the Self. Basically, there are five factors in the human person, all of which are constantly changing, and which make up the illusion of the human Self. The five factors are:

What the Buddha is trying to say is that the sum of these five parts does not make up a greater whole called the Self; all that exists are the parts. The Buddha wanted to remove the notion of the Self because he believed that the idea of the Self is the root of all suffering. It is your desire for self-satisfaction, self-existence, and self-advancement that create pain. If you remove the Self (realise there never was such a thing) suffering will go away.
Since there is no soul or You, then there is no reincarnation. Buddha instead taught Rebirth. Rebirth does not involve getting a new body for an old soul (as taught in Hinduism). Instead, it is the continuation of the Five Aggregates in a long chain of cause and effect. Buddha taught that prior “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” determine the “sensations”, “perceptions”, and “mental formations” of the next life; death does not end this chain.

The Buddha taught that in life there exists dissatisfaction / suffering which is caused by craving and it can be cured (ceased) by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: ', Pāli: '). This teaching is called the Catvāry Āryasatyāni (Pali: ), the "Four Noble Truths".


The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.

The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time. Buddha also said that followers should use his teachings only if they help. He compared worrying about things such as an afterlife while suffering with a person who has been shot with an arrow to worrying about who made the arrow, rather than removing it. As such, there is a strong case for the Buddha's teachings being intended as psychological tools, to ease mental distress, rather than as esoteric teachings for the strongly religious. To attest to this, Buddhist meditation, in particular, is now being scientifically studied in the West, both in laboratory tests, and in real-world, hands-on psychiatry. Many long-term practicing Buddhists, for instance, have been shown to have physically different brain structure, in areas associated with profound joy or spiritual happiness. A possible fusion of Buddhism and psychology can be seen clearly in publications by psychiatrists and psychotherapists, such as Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker.

Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:

The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:


The word samyak means "turned to one point or against each other, universus or adversus; whole, entire, all; correct, right, true." There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the 'Path' as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorise the Eightfold Path into prajñā (Pāli paññā, wisdom), śīla (Pāli sīla, virtuous behaviour) and samādhi (concentration).

Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit. Lit. "awakening") is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by Buddha. Bodhi is most commonly translated into English as "enlightenment", however, a more accurate translation is "awakening" or "understanding". After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of : birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the pāramitās (perfections), when the Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (lobha), hatred (', Pāli dosa), delusion (moha), ignorance (avidyā, Pāli avijjā)), craving (, Pāli ') and false belief in self (ātman, Pāli attā) are extinguished. Bodhi thus includes anātman (Pāli anatta), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise three types of Bodhi. They are Śrāvakabodhi (Pāli: Sāvakabodhi), Pratyekabodhi (Pāli: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (Pāli: Sammāsambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism. 

In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:

According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being: 

In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).

The primarily guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way which was discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment (bodhi). The "Middle Way" or "Middle Path" is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.

Acknowledging the Four Noble Truths and making the first step in The Noble Eightfold Path requires taking refuge, as the foundation of one's religious practice, in Buddhism's Three Jewels (also called Three Treasures, Triple Gem, Triratna or Ratna-traya (Sanskrit), Tiratana (Pali), 三宝, "Sānbǎo" (Chinese), "Sanbō" or "Sanpō" (Japanese), 삼보, "Sambo" (Korean). The Buddha who chooses the Bodhisattva-path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

The Three Jewels are:

गौतम बुद्ध presented himself as a model and beseeched his followers to have faith (śraddhā, Pāli saddhā) in his example of a human who escaped the pain and danger of existence. The Dharma, that is, the teaching of Buddha, offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The , in this sense meaning the group of Buddhists possessing at least some degree of enlightenment, provides a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable. As Buddhism migrated to the West, a new usage of the word has emerged: the usage of the word "sangha" to describe a meditation group or any sort of spiritual community.

Many Buddhists believe that there is no otherworldly salvation from one's karma. The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.

Śīla (Sanskrit) or sīla (Pāli) is usually rendered into English as "behavioral discipline", "morality", or ethics. It is often translated as "precept". It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the "three practices" (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second pāramitā. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of śīla are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.

sīla refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to 'basic morality' (five precepts), 'basic morality with asceticism' (eight precepts), 'novice monkhood' (ten precepts) and 'monkhood' (Vinaya or Patimokkha). Laypeople generally undertake to live by the five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism. The five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as "thou shalt not ...", but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.


In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of celibacy.
The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:

6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<br>
7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<br>
8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.

Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks. In includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

In Mahayana Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see vegetarianism in Buddhism).

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. samatha meditation (Sanskrit: śamatha) and vipassanā meditation (Sanskrit: vipaśyanā). Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jhāna) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana. In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassanā meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to jñāna (Pāli ñāṇa knowledge) vijñāna (Pāli viññāṇa awareness), prajñā (Pāli paññā pure understanding) and thus can lead to nirvāṇa (Pāli nibbāna).

Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. Prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi. It is spoken of as the principal means, by its enlightenment, of attaining , through its revelation of the true nature of all things. Prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās.

Initially, prajñā is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Gautama Buddha taught dharma to his disciples mainly through the mean of discourse or sermon, many attaining bodhi upon hearing Buddha's discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Lastly, one engages in insight (vipassanā, Sanskrit vipaśyanā) meditation (Citation needed) to attain such wisdom at intuitive level. It should be noted that one could theoretically attain bodhi at any point of practice, while listening to a sermon, while conducting business of daily life or while in meditation.

The eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism are:

Soon after the parinirvāṇa (Pāli: parinibbāna, "complete extinguishment") of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teaching to ensure that no errors occur in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (Vinaya).

These schisms occurred "within" the traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mahāyāna movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.

Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (stūpas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands – particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread "Dhamma", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. This led, a century later, to the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and to the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, and from changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions – themselves influenced by Buddhism.

The council also saw the formation of the of the Vibhajjavāda ("school of analytical discourse") out of various schools of the Sthaviravāda lineage. Vibhajjavādins claim that the first step to insight has to be achieved by the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. The Theravāda school claims that the Sarvāstivada and the Dharmaguptaka schools were rejected by the council, although according to other sources the Dharmaguptaka school is classified as one of the Vibhajyavādin schools. However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mahāyāna schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mahāyāna. The Sarvāstivadins have not preserved an independent tradition about the Third Council.

It was long believed in Theravāda tradition that the Pāli language is equivalent to Māgadhī, the eastern dialect of the kingdom of Magadha spoken by the Buddha. However, linguistic comparisons of the Edicts of Aśoka and the language of the Pāli canon show strong differences between the Māgadhī of the Edicts (characterized by such changes as r → l, masculine nominative singular of a-stems in -e, etc.) and Pāli. The greatest similarity to Pāli is found in a dialectal variant of the Edicts written on a rock near Girnar in Gujarat.

Around 100 CE, the convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravāda line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original Tripiṭaka in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the Lotus Sūtra, an early version of the Heart Sūtra and the Amitābha Sūtra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mahāyāna "great vehicle") and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were written in Sanskrit. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahāyāna would flourish and spread in the East from India to Southeast Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 CE.

Mahāyāna Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nāgārjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahāyāna tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with both the Nikāya (Hīnayāna) philosophies and the emerging Mahāyāna tradition. He made explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the Tripiṭaka sūtras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant Sarvāstivāda school, which argued for the existence of dharmas (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, Nāgārjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be śūnya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman (no-self) and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the Madhyamaka.

After the end of the Kuṣāṇas, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th – 6th century). Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India. Sarvāstivāda teaching, which was criticized by Nāgārjuna was reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asaṅga and were incorporated into the Yogācāra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yogācāra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahāyāna theology.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nālandā University became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th-12th century) Nālandā tradition.

Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as Menander I and Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic Greco-Bactrian and Iranian Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the Kushāna Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the Turk-Shāhīs. 

Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a 'Buddha-Mazda' divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.

The Hinayana traditions first spread among the Turkic tribes before combining with the Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, eastern and coastal Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhara, Bactria, Parthia and Sogdia from where it spread to China. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief. 

From the 4th Century CE on, Hindu dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (Pañjāb) and the lower Gangetic plain (Uttar Pradesh and Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the Silk Road as far as China. 

The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian Sāsānids or Tibet. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sāssānids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of "butparast", literally meaning "buddha-worshipper", although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which cult images play a role. Several high officials of the Abbāsid Caliphate, notably the Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.

When Muhammad ibn Qāsim led the invasion of Sindh at the mouth of the Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, Rājā Dahir. Relations with later Arab rulers such as the Saffarids and Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and stūpas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.

Western Central Asia was under the control of first Arab and then Persian Muslims from the 8th century CE on. The Central Asian regions at this point became caught up in political squabbles as the Shahis, Umayyads, Tang dynasty, Khitans, Tibetans, Qarakhanids and other Turkic tribes vied over control of the area. 

After the disintegration of the Abbāsid Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In the 10th century CE, one of them, Mahmūd of Ghaznī, defeated the Hindō-Shāhīs and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the Pañjāb. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and Afghanistan alone and al-Biruni recorded Buddha as a prophet "burxan".

The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Islām as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and shamanism in areas to the east (modern Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.

In 1215 Genghis Khan conquered Afghanistan and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and Chagatai established the Chagatai Khanate while Hulegu established the Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the Il Khanate, Hulegu and his successors Abaqa and Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to Islam and the climate turned hostile to Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after Ghazan's reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia . 

Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in Kaśmīr and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist Pāla kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the Vajrayāna and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to Tibet before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu Sena dynasty. 

Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as Vedānta philosophy and Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an avatāra of the Hindu god Vishnu – an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of nirvāna. 

In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the Pāla kingdom, Muhammad Khiljī destroyed Nālandā, the great Buddhist university. Khiljī was one of the generals of Qutbuddīn Aybak, a subject of the Afghan Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khiljī's march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries. 

After the Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita and the rise of the syncretic bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.

By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Islām, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Kaśmīr Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Islām and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of Ladakh.

Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the Bauls of Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. The Newars of Nepal also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.

Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Vajrayāna is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in Pāli, Tibetan (also found in Mongolian translation) and Chinese collections, along with some texts that still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. This is a useful division for practical purposes, but does not necessarily correspond to philosophical or doctrinal divisions.

Despite the differences, there are common threads to almost all Buddhist branches:

Theravāda is Pāli for "the Doctrine of the Elders". Theravāda teaches one to encourage wholesome states of mind, avoid unwholesome states of mind, and to train the mind in meditation. The ultimate aim of practice, according to Theravāda Buddhism, is the attainment of freedom from suffering. Theravāda teaches that this experience of suffering is caused by mental defilements like greed, aversion and delusion, while freedom can be attained though putting into practice teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Theravāda school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the Pāli Canon and its commentaries. The Sutta collections and Vinaya texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the Tripiṭaka), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is the only surviving representative of the historical early Buddhist schools. Theravāda is primarily practiced today in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: "Great Vehicle") branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion ("maha-karuna"), or bodhicitta - the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the "Awakened Mind" (bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (shunyata), prajna-paramita and Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist pantheism or panentheism (God in Buddhism). 

In addition to the Tripitaka scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahāyāna schools recognize all or part of a genre of Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahāyāna Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.

Native Mahāyāna Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka and most of Vietnam. The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahāyāna in origin, but will be discussed below under the heading of Vajrayāna. Some of the sects of the Mahāyāna include the various schools and traditions within Chan/Zen and Pure Land.

The Vajrayāna or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism) shares the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Vajrayāna Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness. These profound states are in turn to be used as an efficient path to Buddhahood. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In addition to the Theravāda and Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of texts that include the Buddhist Tantras. Native Vajrayāna is practiced today mainly in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, areas of India, and – in the Shingon ("Zhènyān", 真言) and Tendai schools – in China and Japan.

In his lifetime, Gautama Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing enlightenment.

In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The "prajna-paramita" sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled "Uttara-Tantra", the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the "All-Creating King" (Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there: 

"The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable." ("The Sovereign All-Creating Mind" tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111–112).

Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist yogi and teacher mahasiddha Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his 6 words of advice.

Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts. See e.g. Abhidharma, Buddhist philosophy and Reality in Buddhism.

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of scripture is known in Sanskrit as the Tripitaka and in Pāli as the Tipitaka. These terms literally mean "three baskets" and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:


Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings – sūtras (Sanskrit) or suttas (Pāli) – and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upāli, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripiṭaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the sūtras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha's previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.

The Theravāda and other Nikāya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Theravāda canon, also known as the Pāli Canon after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the Mahāyāna sūtras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the nāgas), or came directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mahāyāna sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the āgamas. Whereas the Theravādins adhere solely to the āgamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mahāyāna accept both the agamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Theravādins, however, the Mahayana sūtras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada. For the Mahāyānists, in contrast, the āgamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mahāyāna sutras articulate the Buddha's higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name "Mahāyāna" (lit., "the Great Vehicle"), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The "Great" of "Maha-yana" is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for all future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha's "Great Self" ("mahatman") in the sphere of "Great Nirvana" ("mahanirvana"). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged "greatness" proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to "true".

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture. Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching- into his Buddhist Bible in the 1920's. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his “The Buddha and His Dhamma”. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.

Estimates of the number of Buddhists vary but the most common figure today is 350 million.


At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. (see Buddhism in the West)

Buddhism is a fertile ground for comparative studies with different beliefs, philosophy, science, history, and various other aspects of Buddhism. In term of doctrine, dependent origination is Buddhism's primary contribution to metaphysics. This has wide-ranging implication in terms of theology, philosophy, and science. On the other hand, Buddhist emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but it has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various local beliefs, customs, and institutions in adopted countries for most of its history.

बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट निस्केको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा बुद्ध शाक्यमुनि (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए । ती छैंटौं पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । तिनका बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा, बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुइ हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैल गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथा सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्म छ ।

"बुद्ध" ती कहलाउँछन्, जिन्हुने सालहरुका ध्यान पछि यथार्थताको सत्य भाव पहिचानयो छ । यस पहचानलाई बोधि नाम दिइएको छ । जुन पनि "अज्ञानताको नींद"बाट जाग्दछन्, ती "बुद्ध" कहलाउँछन् । भनिन्छ कि बुद्ध शाक्यमुनि केवल एक बुद्ध छन् - तीका पहिले धेरै सारा थिए र भविष्यमा र हहरुगे । उनको भन्न थियो कि कुनै पनि बुद्ध बन सक्दछ यदि त्यो तीका "धर्म"का अनुसार एक धार्मिक जीवन जीए र आफ्नो बुद्धिलाई शुद्ध गरियोस् । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य छ यस दुःख भरी स्थितिको अंत । "म केवल एक नैं पदार्थ सिखाता हूँ - दुःख र दुःख निरोध" (बुद्ध) । बौद्ध धर्मका अनुयायी आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार जीकर अज्ञानता र दुःखबाट मुक्ति र निर्वाण पानको कोशिश गर्दछन् । 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको जगह,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परंपरागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केहि अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्नने को लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरु मा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मौत हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दर्द, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केहि साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केहि र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल याद आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केहि शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केहि दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका पास सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग संप्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केहि सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरु को लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केहि अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केहि पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका पास ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केहि दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केहि साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न

८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़ने को लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केहि क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केहि पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य जगह बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केहि देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।

बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा बुद्ध शाक्यमुनि (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुइ हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति "अज्ञानताको नींद"बाट पुर्णरूपले जाग्दछन्, ती "बुद्ध" कहलाउँछन् । भनिन्छ कि बुद्ध शाक्यमुनि केवल एक बुद्ध छन् - तीका पहिले धेरै सारा थिए र भविष्यमा र हहरुगे । उनको भन्न थियो कि कुनै पनि बुद्ध बन सक्दछ यदि त्यो तीका "धर्म"का अनुसार एक धार्मिक जीवन जीए र आफ्नो बुद्धिलाई शुद्ध गरियोस् । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य छ यस दुःख भरी स्थितिको अंत । "म केवल एक नैं पदार्थ सिखाता हूँ - दुःख र दुःख निरोध" (बुद्ध) । बौद्ध धर्मका अनुयायी आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार जीकर अज्ञानता र दुःखबाट मुक्ति र निर्वाण पानको कोशिश गर्दछन् ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परंपरागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केहि अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्नने को लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरु मा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मौत हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दर्द, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केहि साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केहि र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल याद आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केहि शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केहि दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका पास सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग संप्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केहि सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरु को लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केहि अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केहि पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका पास ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केहि दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केहि साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़ने को लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केहि क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केहि पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य जगह बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केहि देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुइ हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो बुद्ध आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खमुक्तिको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खमुक्तिको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म दुई कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको जगह,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केहि शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केहि दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका पास सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केहि साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न

८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़ने को लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केहि क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केहि पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य जगह बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केहि देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुइ हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म दुई कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको जगह,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परंपरागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केहि अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्नने को लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरु मा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मौत हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दर्द, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केहि साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केहि र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल याद आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केहि शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केहि दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका पास सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग संप्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केहि सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरु को लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केहि अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केहि पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका पास ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केहि दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केहि अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्नने को लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरु मा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मौत हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दर्द, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केहि साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केहि र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल याद आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केहि शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केहि दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका पास सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग संप्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केहि सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरु को लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केहि अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केहि पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका पास ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केहि दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केहि साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़ने को लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केहि क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केहि पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य जगह बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केहि देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुइ हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म दुई कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केहि शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केहि दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका पास सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केहि साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न

७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़ने को लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केहि क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केहि पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य जगह बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केहि देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुइ हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म दुई कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको जगह,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केहि अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्नने को लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरु मा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मौत हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दर्द, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केहि साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केहि र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल याद आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केहि शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केहि दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका पास सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग संप्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केहि सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरु को लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केहि अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केहि पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका पास ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केहि दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्नने को लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरु मा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मौत हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दर्द, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल याद आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका पास सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग संप्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरु को लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका पास ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़ने को लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य जगह बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुइ हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म दुई कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजिकै सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न

७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़ने को लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुइ हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्नने को लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरु मा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजिकै सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग संप्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरु को लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका नजिकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्नने को लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरु मा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजिकै सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग संप्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरु को लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका नजिकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़ने को लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरु को लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका नजिकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़ने को लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुइ हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्नने को लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरु मा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालन को लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजिकै सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्ष को लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरुमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजिकै सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुइ सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग संप्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरुको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका नजिकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारंभ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुइ मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरुको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका नजिकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरुमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजिकै सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुई सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरुमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजिकै सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुई सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरुको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका नजिकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरुको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका नजिकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरुमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरुमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान । बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरु मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरुमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजिकै सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुई सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसंग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।" । शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो । उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा ।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरुका राजा । परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो । भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरुमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरुलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरु, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरु ।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरु सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि । ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरु, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले । फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरुबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले । फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न । यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरुका उत्तर पाहरु, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे । यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए । ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरुका बीचमा छ । आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो । ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये । उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजिकै सागर्नुथमा थियो । 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरु दुइटैलाई । उनले दुई सन्यासीहरुका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो ।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरुका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरुको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ । परंतु, मानव, जसका नजिकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ । जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरु सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरुलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरुका बारेमा थियो ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरु न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरु आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ । र मानिसहरुलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरुमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ । सारी पारमिताहरु (पूर्णताहरु)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरुको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ । यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि । सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ । 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ । केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरु आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरुको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन् ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ । यो थेरावादीहरुलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन् ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो।

गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फ़िरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ । केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फ़ैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फ़ैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फ़िर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फ़िर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फ़िर पनि नमिले। फ़िर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फ़िर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फ़ैल्याउन जारी राखयो।

बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको । ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।

गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।

बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।

गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरुहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।

बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरूहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।

गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरूहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।

बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरूहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरूहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।

बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म लुंबिनी, कपिलवस्तु (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)का पासको ठाँउ,मा भएको थियो। लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरूहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म नेपालको कपिलवस्तु जिल्लाको लुम्बिनी (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)को पासको ठाँउमा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरूहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ। उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरू बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ। भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो। 

बुद्ध शाक्य गोत्रका थिए र उनको वास्तविक नाम सिद्धार्थ थियो। उनको जन्म नेपालको कपिलवस्तु जिल्लाको लुम्बिनी (शाक्य महाजनपदको राजधानी)को पासको ठाँउमा भएको थियो । लुंबिनीका ठीक स्थानमा, जुन दक्षिण मध्य नेपालमा छ, महाराज अशोकले तेस्रो शताब्दी ईसा पूर्वमा एक स्तम्भ बनाए थियो, बुद्धका जन्मका गुणगानमा।

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको। फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु। यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ। उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरूहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ।

४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न

६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न

सिद्धार्थका पिता शुद्धोदन थिए, शाक्यहरूका राजा। परम्परागत कथाका अनुसार, सिद्धार्थको माता तीका जन्मका केही अबेर पछि मर गएकोथियो। भनिन्छ कि जब उनको नाम रख्ननेको लागि ८ ऋषियोलाई आमन्त्रित गरे सबैले २ सम्भावानाये जताई १ या त त्यो महान राजा बनेगे या फेरि एक महान साधुमा उन्मे भन्दा एक ऋषिले सिद्धार्थबाट मिलेर भन्यो कि त्यो एक महान साधु छगे। यस भविष्य वाणीलाई सुनेर राजा शुद्धोदानले आफ्नो योग्यताको हद सम्म सिद्धार्थलाई दुःख भन्दा टाढा राखनको कोशिशको । फिर भी, २९ वर्षको उमेरमा, उनको दृष्टि चार दृश्यहरूमा पडी (संस्कृत चतुर निमित्त) - एक बूढ़े अपाहिज मानिस, एक बीमार मानिस, एक मुरझाती भए ला श, र एक साधु । यी चार दृश्यहरूलाई देखेर सिद्धार्थ समझ गये कि सबको जन्म हुन्छ, सबको बुढ़ापा आउँछ, सबलाई रोग हुन्छ, र एक दिन, सबको मृत्यु हुन्छ । उनले आफ्नो धनवान जीवन, आफ्नो जाति, आफ्नो पत्नी, आफ्नो बच्चाहरू, सबलाई छोडएर साधुको जीवन आफ्नो लियो ताकि ती जन्म, बुढ़ापे, दुखाइ, रोग, र मौतका बारेमा कुनै उत्तर खोज पाहरू।

सिद्धार्थले पान्च ब्बाटो्मणहरू सहित आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर ढूंढने शुरू गरि। ती उचित ध्यान पा पहरू, तर उन्हे उत्तर नमिले। फिर उनले तपस्या गर्नको कोशिशको। ती यस कार्यमा पनि प्रवीण निकले, आफ्नो गुरूहरूबाट पनि ज्यादा, तर उन्हे आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर फिर पनि नमिले। फिर उनले केही साथी इकठ्ठे गरि र चल दिये अधिक कठोर तपस्या गर्न। यस्तो गर्दै गर्दै छः वर्ष बाद, भूखका कारण मरनका करीब-करीबबाट गुजरकर, बिना आफ्नो प्रश्नहरूका उत्तर पाहरू, ती फिर केही र गर्नका बारेमा सोचने लागे। यस समय, उन्हे आफ्नो बाल्यकालको एक पल सम्झना आयो जब तीका पिता खेत तयार गर्न शुरू गर रहे थिए। ती समय ती एक आछैनद भरे ध्यानमा पड गये थिए र उन्हे यस्तो महसूस भयो कि समय स्थित भएको छ।

कठोर तपस्या छोडएर उनले आर्य अष्टांग मार्ग ढूंढ निकाले, जुन बीचको मार्ग पनि कहलाता जान्छ किन भने यो मार्ग दुइटै तपस्या र असंयमको पाराकाष्टाहरूका बीचमा छ। आफ्नो बदनमा केही शक्ति हालनको लागि, उनले एक बकरी-वाला भन्दा केही दूध लि लियो। ती एक पिउँपलका रुख़ (जो अब बोधि रुख़ कहलाउँछ)का तल बस गये प्रतिज्ञा गरेर कि ती सत्य जाने बिना उठेंगे न। ३५को उमेरमा, उनले बोधि पाए र ती बुद्ध बन गये। उनको पहिला धर्मोपदेश वाराणसीका नजीकै सागर्नुथमा थियो। 

आफ्नो बाकीका ४५ वर्षको लागि, गौतम बुद्धले गंगा नदीका छेउ-छाउ आफ्नो धर्मोपदेश दियो, धनवान र कंगाल मानिसहरू दुइटैलाई। उनले दुई सन्यासीहरूका संघको पनि स्थापना जिन्हुने बुद्धका धर्मोपदेशलाई फैल्याउन जारी राखयो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 
१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 
केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म भारतको श्रमण परम्पराबाट जन्मेको धर्म र दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहा“को गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदानगर्न लुम्बिनीविकास काषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा“प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धितविषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न् सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ । 
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहा“को सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हि“ड्दे मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालुहरु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

धार्मिक महत्व तथा ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमिः

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔंदेखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहा“ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुड्डाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहा“लाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउ“हरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनिया“ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पा“चौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवद्र्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्मा कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



"ढल्के अक्षर"
बौद्ध धर्ममानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहा“को गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदानगर्न लुम्बिनीविकास काषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा“प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धितविषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न् सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ । 
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहा“को सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हि“ड्दे मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालुहरु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

धार्मिक महत्व तथा ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमिः

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔंदेखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहा“ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुड्डाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहा“लाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउ“हरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनिया“ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पा“चौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवद्र्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्मा कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुड्डा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रस“ग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारस“ग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजनाः
प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु ग¥यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
कं) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धका गुजरने पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित छ गये छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार अछैनत संसारको चक्र। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा के) हुन्छ, केही पनि सचमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागकर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पा सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढे हुनेमा, रोगमा, मौतमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनेमा, नापसंद चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहतलाई न पानमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहत, दुःखको कारण छ र फिरबाट सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाए जानसक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाए जानसक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिेको थियो, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थियो।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य स्त्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग छ दुःख निरोध पानको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ ः 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक बात्नुहोस् र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू न गर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार न गर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारनेको कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देखनेको मानसिक योग्यता पानको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका समझते छ, जसमा अगाड़ि बढ़नेको लागि, पछिल्लोका स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ। र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाए जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि कहलाते छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पान पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइन सक्छ। सारी पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा समझ, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाए जानसक्दछ। यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब छ जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन् ः श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानी जान्छ। 

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



"ढल्के अक्षर"
बौद्ध धर्ममानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहा“को गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदानगर्न लुम्बिनीविकास काषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा“प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धितविषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न् सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ । 
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहा“को सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हि“ड्दे मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालुहरु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

धार्मिक महत्व तथा ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमिः

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔंदेखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहा“ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुड्डाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहा“लाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउ“हरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनिया“ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पा“चौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवद्र्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्मा कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।
लुम्बिनीका धरोहरहरुः
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुीम्बनी एक महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित ग¥यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

मायादेवी मन्दिरुः
यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन ् । 

जन्म स्मारक शिलाः
जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउ“छ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवी मूर्तिः
मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हा“गा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहा“की बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

पवित्र पोखरी(पुष्करिणी)ः
अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहा“ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भः
अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

नया“ लुम्बिनीः
सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुड्डा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रस“ग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारस“ग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजनाः
प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु ग¥यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
कं) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



"ढल्के अक्षर"
बौद्ध धर्ममानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहा“को गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदानगर्न लुम्बिनीविकास काषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा“प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धितविषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न् सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ । 
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहा“को सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हि“ड्दे मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालुहरु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

धार्मिक महत्व तथा ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमिः

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔंदेखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहा“ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुड्डाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहा“लाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउ“हरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनिया“ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पा“चौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवद्र्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्मा कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।
लुम्बिनीका धरोहरहरुः
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुीम्बनी एक महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित ग¥यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

मायादेवी मन्दिरुः
यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन ् । 

जन्म स्मारक शिलाः
जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउ“छ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवी मूर्तिः
मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हा“गा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहा“की बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

पवित्र पोखरी(पुष्करिणी)ः
अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहा“ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भः
अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

नया“ लुम्बिनीः
सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुड्डा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रस“ग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारस“ग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजनाः
प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु ग¥यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
कं) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भएरा छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ। सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ। त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानीन्छ।

इस दुनियामा सबै केही क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी न। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ। 

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहा“को गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदानगर्न लुम्बिनीविकास काषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा“प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धितविषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न् सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ । 
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहा“को सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हि“ड्दे मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालुहरु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

धार्मिक महत्व तथा ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमिः

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔंदेखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहा“ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुड्डाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहा“लाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउ“हरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनिया“ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पा“चौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवद्र्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्मा कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।
लुम्बिनीका धरोहरहरुः
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुीम्बनी एक महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित ग¥यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

मायादेवी मन्दिरुः
यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन ् । 

जन्म स्मारक शिलाः
जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउ“छ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवी मूर्तिः
मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हा“गा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहा“की बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

पवित्र पोखरी(पुष्करिणी)ः
अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहा“ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भः
अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

नया“ लुम्बिनीः
सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुड्डा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रस“ग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारस“ग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजनाः
प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु ग¥यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
कं) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भएरा छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ। सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ। त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानीन्छ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने दुनिया प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ।मा अन्य ठाँउ बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भन्एको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानी गयी छ,मा त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैनन्।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



"ढल्के अक्षर"
बौद्ध धर्ममानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहा“को गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदानगर्न लुम्बिनीविकास काषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा“प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धितविषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न् सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ । 
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहा“को सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हि“ड्दे मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालुहरु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

धार्मिक महत्व तथा ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमिः

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔंदेखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहा“ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुड्डाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहा“लाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउ“हरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनिया“ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पा“चौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवद्र्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्मा कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।
लुम्बिनीका धरोहरहरुः
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुीम्बनी एक महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित ग¥यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुड्डा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रस“ग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारस“ग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजनाः
प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु ग¥यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
कं) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भएरा छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ। सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ। त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानीन्छ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन छ। 

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



"ढल्के अक्षर"
बौद्ध धर्ममानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहा“को गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदानगर्न लुम्बिनीविकास काषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा“प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धितविषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न् सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ । 
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहा“को सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हि“ड्दे मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालुहरु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

धार्मिक महत्व तथा ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमिः

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔंदेखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहा“ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुड्डाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहा“लाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउ“हरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनिया“ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पा“चौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवद्र्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्मा कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।
लुम्बिनीका धरोहरहरुः
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुीम्बनी एक महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित ग¥यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

मायादेवी मन्दिरुः
यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन ् । 

जन्म स्मारक शिलाः
जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउ“छ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवी मूर्तिः
मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हा“गा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहा“की बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

पवित्र पोखरी(पुष्करिणी)ः
अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहा“ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भः
अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

नया“ लुम्बिनीः
सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुड्डा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रस“ग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारस“ग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजनाः
प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु ग¥यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
कं) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



"ढल्के अक्षर"
बौद्ध धर्ममानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो। यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए। उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार सालहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलन गयो। आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबै भन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयाशले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदेशना गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भैसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन। बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति। बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे। उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।"। शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहा“को गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदानगर्न लुम्बिनीविकास काषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा“प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धितविषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न् सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ । 
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहा“को सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हि“ड्दे मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालुहरु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

धार्मिक महत्व तथा ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमिः

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔंदेखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहा“ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुड्डाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहा“लाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउ“हरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनिया“ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पा“चौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवद्र्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्मा कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।
लुम्बिनीका धरोहरहरुः
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुीम्बनी एक महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित ग¥यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

मायादेवी मन्दिरुः
यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन ् । 

जन्म स्मारक शिलाः
जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउ“छ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवी मूर्तिः
मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हा“गा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहा“की बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

पवित्र पोखरी(पुष्करिणी)ः
अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहा“ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भः
अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

नया“ लुम्बिनीः
सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुड्डा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रस“ग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारस“ग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजनाः
प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु ग¥यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
कं) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भएरा छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ। सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ। त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानीन्छ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहा“को गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदानगर्न लुम्बिनीविकास काषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा“प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धितविषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न् सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ । 
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहा“को सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हि“ड्दे मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालुहरु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

धार्मिक महत्व तथा ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमिः

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔंदेखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहा“ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुड्डाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहा“लाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउ“हरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनिया“ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पा“चौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवद्र्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्मा कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।
लुम्बिनीका धरोहरहरुः
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुीम्बनी एक महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित ग¥यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

मायादेवी मन्दिरुः
यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन ् । 

जन्म स्मारक शिलाः
जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउ“छ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवी मूर्तिः
मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हा“गा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहा“की बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

पवित्र पोखरी(पुष्करिणी)ः
अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहा“ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भः
अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

नया“ लुम्बिनीः
सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुड्डा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रस“ग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारस“ग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजनाः
प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु ग¥यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
कं) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ। 
गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका अलग-अलग सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भएरा छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन्।
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ। सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ। त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानीन्छ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म मानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहाँको गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदान गर्न लुम्बिनी विकास कोषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धित विषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ ।
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हु“दै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हा“गा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहा“की बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ ।

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
कं) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । 

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ। प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन। किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन। हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन्।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ। 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ। 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ। 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो। गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन्। मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि। 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ। मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ। सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ। त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन्। बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानीन्छ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म मानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहाँको गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदान गर्न लुम्बिनी विकास कोषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धित विषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ ।
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँ“बाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् । 

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो ।

गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

बौद्ध धर्म मानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहाँको गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदान गर्न लुम्बिनी विकास कोषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धित विषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ ।
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । 

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म मानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहाँको गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदान गर्न लुम्बिनी विकास कोषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धित विषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ ।
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । 

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बौद्ध धर्म मानबिय सुख र शान्तीको खोजक्रममा जन्मेको दर्शन हो । यसका प्रस्थापक महात्मा शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) थिए जसलाई बौद्ध परम्पराहरूमा वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सम्प्रदाय छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ । जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहाँको गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदान गर्न लुम्बिनी विकास कोषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धित विषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ ।
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल लुम्बिनी, वहाँको गृहराज्य कपिलवस्तुका महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरु तथा मावली देवदह र रामग्रामका सम्बन्धमा संक्षिप्त जानकारी प्रदान गर्न लुम्बिनी विकास कोषबाट प्रकाशित यो सानो पुस्तिका अध्ययन गर्न लाग्नु भएकोमा यहा प्रति कोष आभार व्यक्त गर्दछ । यो संक्षिप्त पुस्तिकाबाट विश्वमानव जगतकै अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थलहरुको बारेमा बिस्तृत जानकारी लिन सम्भव नभए पनि पाठकले मूख्य–मूख्य जानकारी भने अवश्य लिन सक्नुहुनेछ भन्नेमा कोष आशावादी रहेको छ । थप जानकारी लिन उत्सुक पाठकहरुले कोषमा सम्पर्क राख्न वा सम्बन्धित विषयवस्तुका बारेमा प्रकाशित विभिन्न सामग्रीहरुको अध्ययन गर्न सक्नुहुनेछ ।
लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । 

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । 

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । 

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बौद्ध धर्ममा दुई मुख्य साम्प्रदाय छन्:

थेरवाद या हीनयान बुद्धका मौलिक उपदेश नैं मान्दछ।

महायान बुद्धको पूजा गर्दछ। यो थेरावादीहरूलाई "हीनयान" (सानो गाडी ) भन्दछन्।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः

सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्ध ईश्वरको सत्ता मान्दैनन् किन भने संसार प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादका नियममा चल्दछ। अन्य ठाँउमा बुद्धले सर्वोच्च सत्यलाई अवर्णनीय भनिएको छ। केही देवताहरूको सत्ता मानीएको छ, त्यो ज्यादा शक्तिशाली छैन।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐछिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिलरहका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पदम हुम रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् । 

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः

प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् ।

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः

प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्तेपछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् ।

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्ते पछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् ।

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्ते पछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् ।

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।


बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्ते पछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् ।

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज न। जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा समझ्दछन्, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्ते पछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् ।

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

सन् १९६७ मा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महासचिव ऊ थान्तको लुम्बिनी भ्रमण नै आधुनिक लुम्बिनीको विकासको सम्बन्धमा कोसेढुंगा सावित भयो । लुम्बिनीको महत्व तथा पवित्रताबाट अति प्रभावित भएर उनले स्वर्गीय श्री ५ महेन्द्रसँग छलफल गर्नुका साथै नेपाल सरकारसँग लुम्बिनीलाई अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय तीर्थस्थल तथा पर्यटन केन्द्रको रुपमा विकास गर्न सल्लाह दिए । सन् १९७० मा उनले संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघको सहभागितामा लुम्बिनीको विकास गर्न १५ सदस्य राष्ट्र भएको ‘लुम्बिनी विकासका लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समिति’ गठन गर्न सहयोग गरे । लुम्बिनीको योजनाबद्ध विकासको लागि सन् १९७२ मा जापानी नागरिक प्रा.केन्जा टांगेलाई लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना तयार गर्ने गहन जिम्मेवारी दिइयो । 

प्रा.केन्जो टांगेद्धारा तयार पारिएको लुम्बिनी गुरुयोजना नेपाल सरकार तथा संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघबाट सन् १९७८ मा पारित भयो । त्यस अगाडि नै नेपाली सरकारले लुम्बिनीको विकासका लागि लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरिसकेको थियो । उक्त समितिले स्थानीय वासिन्दाहरुको जग्गा अधिग्रहण गरी विकासका पूर्वाधारहरुको निर्माण र वृक्षारोपण जस्ता कार्यहरु गर्यो । अहिले पनि लुम्बिनी विकास कोष उक्त गुरुयोजना अनुरुप संरचनाहरु निर्माण गर्न क्रियाशील रहेको छ । 
गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रले ३ वर्गमाइल क्षेत्रफल ओगटेको छ । यस क्षेत्रलाई प्रत्येक १ वर्ग माइलका ३ क्षेत्रहरुमा विभाजित गरी पैदल बाटो र केन्द्रीय नहरुले जोडिएको छ । ती ३ क्षेत्रहरुः
क) पवित्र उदान ख) विहार क्षेत्र ग) नयाँ लुम्बिनी ग्राम हुन् ।
प्रा.केन्जा टांगेको डिजाइनको प्रमुख आकर्षण नै दक्षिणी भागमा अवस्थित पवित्र उद्यान हो । यस क्षेत्रको डिजाइनको प्रमुख उद्देश्य आध्यात्मिकता, शान्ति, विश्व भातृत्व र अहिंसाको वातावरण सृजना गर्नुका साथै संसारका लागि भगवान बुद्धको समयानुकूल सन्देश प्रतिविम्बित गर्नु हो । पवित्र उद्यानमा पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक धरोहरु अवस्थित छन् भने बगैंचा र सुन्दर पोखरीहरुले यस क्षेत्रलाई अत्यन्त मनमोहन बनाएका छन् । पवित्र उद्यानदेखि उत्तरपट्टि मध्य भागमा जंगलभित्र अवस्थित विहार क्षेत्रलाई केन्द्रीय नहरले विभाजित गरेको छ । पश्चिम विहार क्षेत्रमा २९ वटा प्लटहरु महायानी बौद्धमार्गीहरुका लागि र पूर्वी विहार क्षेत्रमा १३ वटा प्लटहरु थेरवादीहरुका लागि छुट्याइएको छ । 
सांस्कृतिक केन्द्रमा अनुसन्धान केन्द्र तथा पुस्तकालय, सभागृह र संग्राहलय अवस्थित छन् जसबाट बौद्ध धर्मसम्बन्धी अध्ययन तथा अनुसन्धानकर्ताहरुलाई सुविधा पुग्दछ । गुरुयोजना क्षेत्रको उत्तरी भाग नया“ लुम्बिनी ग्रामको रुपमा विकास भइरहेको छ । यात्रु तथा पर्यटकहरुले यस स्थानमा आरामदायी होटल, लज, रेष्टुरेण्ट तथा अन्य सुविधाहरु प्राप्त गर्नेछन् ।

मूल लेख बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशील

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडी बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज छैन । जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा सम्झन्छन, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
भगवान गौतम बुद्ध तथागतको महापरिनिर्वाण लगत्ते पछि लुम्बिनी एउटा महत्वपूर्ण आध्यात्मिक स्थलको रुपमा परिवर्तन भयो । लुम्बिनीको सबैभन्दा पवित्र जन्म विन्दुले श्रद्धालु भक्तजनहरुको ध्यान आकर्षित गर्यो । फलस्वरुप भगवानप्रति श्रद्धाञ्जलिका लागि विभिन्न स्तुपहरु तथा विहारहरु निर्माण भए । यी निर्माणहरु धार्मिक प्रवृत्तिका थिए ।

यस पवित्र स्थलमा रहेका सम्पूर्ण धरोहरहरुमध्ये मायादेवी मन्दिर प्रमुख आकर्षणको केन्द्रविन्दु हो । विभिन्न शताब्दीमा निर्मित मन्दिरका विभिन्न तहहरुले यसको महत्व तथा प्राचीनता माथि प्रकाश पार्दछ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मदृश्य सहितको प्राचीन मायादेवी मूर्ति यस मन्दिरभित्र अवस्थित छ । मन्दिरभित्रका भग्नावशेषहरु ई.पू.तेश्रो शताब्दीदेखि सातौं शताब्दीसम्मका छन् ।

जन्मस्मारक शिला एक गहिरो कोठामा रहेको छ । जसले भगवान बुद्धको जन्म विन्दुलाई स्पष्ट देखाउँछ । मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरको सघन उत्खनन् पश्चात् यो शिला सन् १९९६ मा पत्ता लागेको हो ।

मायादेवीको मूर्तिलाई जन्म मूर्ति पनि भनिन्छ । चौथो शताब्दीमा निर्मित यस मुर्तिले बुद्ध भगवानको जन्म दृश्यलाई देखाएको छ । मायादेवीले सहाराको लागि दाहिने हातले रुखको हाँगा समात्नु भएको छ । देब्रेपट्टि छेउमा उहाँकी बहिनी प्रजापति उभिइरहनु भएको छ भने दुई देवगणहरु भगवानलाई लिनका लागि तयारी अवस्थामा देखिन्छन् र नवजात बुद्धको मूर्ति बीचमा देखिन्छ । 

अशोकस्तम्भको दक्षिणमा पवित्र पुष्करिणी अवस्थित छ । मायादेवीले बुद्ध भगवानलाई जन्म दिनुभन्दा अगाडि यहाँ नुहाउनु भएको थियो साथै भगवानलाई पनि यहमा“ प्रथम स्नान गराई शुद्ध बनाइएको थियो भन्ने विश्वास रहेको छ । 

अशोक स्तम्भमा कु“दिएका शिलालेखले भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्मस्थलको बारेमा ऐतिहासिक प्रमाण दिन्छ । भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थल र लुम्बिनीको सम्बन्धमा यो स्तम्भमा भएको शिलालेख नै सबैभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण आधिकारिक तथा ऐतिहासिक अभिलेख हो ।

बौद्ध धर्ममा पञ्चशीलको ज्यादै ठूलो महत्व रहन्छ । यो बुद्ध धर्मको आधारभूत पाँच शीलहरुको संग्रह हो। अङ्गुत्तरनिकायको अट्ठकादिनिपातमा रहेको दुच्‍चरितविपाकसुत्तमा यी शीलहरुका वर्णन गरिएका छन्। अंगुत्तरनिकायमा दशकनिपातको जाणुस्सोणिवग्गोमा पनि पञ्चशीलको भाव पाइन्छ। सुत्तपिटकको खुद्दकनिकायको खुद्दकपाठमा दशसिक्खापदं भनिएको १० वटा शीलमध्ये पहिलो पाँच पञ्चशीलका शील हुन्। पञ्चशीललाई बुद्ध धर्ममा प्रवेश गर्ने मूलद्वारको रुपमा लिइन्छ। यस अनुसार बुद्धको मार्गमा हिंड्नको लागि प्राणीहिंसा नगर्ने, रक्सी वा मद्यपान नगर्ने, चोरी नगर्ने वा नदिएको नलिने, झुठो कुरा नबोल्ने र आफ्नो पति/पत्नी बाहेक अरुसंग नलाग्ने (भिक्षुहरुले चाहिं कोहीसंग पनि व्यभिचार नगर्ने) प्रण गर्ने गरिन्छ। पञ्चशीलको चाखलाग्दो र अनौठो कुरा के छ भने यस पाठमा कुनै पनि ठाउँमा आफ्नो पुरानो धर्म त्याग्ने वा अरु धर्म छोड्ने विधि लेखिएको छैन। साथै, यी नियमहरु पालना नगरेमा ईश्वर वा कुनै भौतिक शक्तिद्वारा दण्डित गर्ने (वा नर्कमा जाने) पनि उल्लेख गरिएको छैन। धर्म पालना नितान्त व्यक्तिगत रुपमा छोडिएको छ। अतः, बुद्ध धर्म फैलिएका ठाउँमा बुद्ध धर्म भन्दा पहिलेका विश्वासहरुलाई पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। जस्तै: तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्ममा बोन संस्कृति, दक्षिण तथा दक्षिण पूर्वी एसियाली बुद्ध धर्ममा हिन्दू संस्कृति, जापानमा शिन्तो, चीनमा ताओ र कन्फ्युसियस संस्कृति बुद्ध धर्म संगै गांसिएको देखिन्छ। यसो हुनुमा पञ्चशीलको उदारता एउटा कारण हो।

बुद्ध धर्मको मूल ग्रन्थ त्रिपिटक हो। यो ग्रन्थ भगवान बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात उहाँका शिष्यहरुले उहाँका उपदेशहरुलाई सुत्रबद्ध गर्ने क्रममा निर्माण भएको ग्रन्थ हो। यस ग्रन्थमा उपदेशहरुलाई "सूत्र" (पालिभाषामा सुत्त)को रुपमा राखिएका छन। सूत्रहरुको संकलनलाई वर्ग (पालिमा वग्ग) र कुनै वग्गहरुलाई निकायमा (सुत्तपिटकमा) वा निकाय जस्तै प्रकारका खण्डहरुमा संग्रहित गरिएका छन। यी निकायहरुलाई संकलन गरी तीन "पिटक" (शाब्दिक अर्थमा टोकरी वा डोको) बनाइएका छन। यी तीन पिटकको संग्रहलाई त्रि-पिटक (पालिमा तिपिटक) भनिन्छ।

गौतम बुद्धको अन्त्य पछि, बौद्ध धर्मका बेग्ला-बेग्लै सम्प्रदाय उपस्थित भइसकेका छन्, तर यी सबैका केही सिद्धान्त मिल्दछन् ।

प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादको सिद्धान्त भन्दछ कि कुनै पनि घटना केवल दोस्रो घटनाहरूका कारण नैं एक जटिल कारण-परिणामका जालमा विद्यमान हुन्छ । प्राणीहरूको लागि, यसको अर्थ छ कर्म]] र विपाक (कर्मका परिणाम)का अनुसार संसारको चक्र छैन । किन भने सबै केही अनित्य र अनात्मं (बिना आत्मा को) हुन्छ, केही पनि सच्चाइमा विद्यमान छैन । हरेक घटना मूलतः शुन्य हुन्छ। परंतु, मानव, जसका नजीकै ज्ञानको शक्ति छ, तृष्णा लाई, जुन दुःखको कारण छ, त्यागेर, तृष्णामा नष्टको भए शक्तिलाई ज्ञान र ध्यानमा बदलेर, निर्वाण पाउन सक्दछन् ।

१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ । 

बुद्धको पहिले धर्मोपदेश, जुन उनले आफ्नो साथका केही साधुहरूलाई दिएका थिए, यी चार आर्य सत्यहरूका बारेमा थिए ।

बौद्ध धर्मका अनुसार, चौथो आर्य सत्यको आर्य अष्टाण्ग मार्ग हो दुःख निरोध पाउनको बाटो । गौतम बुद्ध भन्थे कि चार आर्य सत्यको सत्यताको निश्चय गर्नको लागि यस मार्गको अनुसरण गर्नु पर्छ :- 

१. सम्यक दृष्टि : चार आर्य सत्यमा विश्वास गर्न 
२. सम्यक संकल्प : मानसिक र नैतिक विकासको प्रतिज्ञा गर्न 
३. सम्यक वाक : हानिकारक कुरा नगर्न र झूट न बोल्न 
४. सम्यक कर्म : हानिकारक कर्महरू नगर्न 
५. सम्यक जीविका : कुनै पनि स्पष्टतः या अस्पष्टतः हानिकारक व्यापार नगर्न 
६. सम्यक प्रयास : आफै सुधारने कोशिश गर्न 
७. सम्यक स्मृति : स्पष्ट ज्ञानबाट देख्ने मानसिक योग्यता पाउनको कोशिश गर्न 
८. सम्यक समाधि : निर्वाण पाउन र स्वयंको गायब हुनु 

केहि मानिसहरू आर्य अष्टांग मार्गलाई पथको तरिका भनेर सोच्दछन्, जसमा अगाडि बढ्नको लागि, पछिल्लो स्तरलाई पाउन आवश्यक छ र मानिसहरूलाई लग्दछ कि यस मार्गका स्तर सबै संग-संगै पाएर जान्छन् । मार्गलाई तीन हिस्साहरूमा वर्गीकृत गरिन्छ : प्रज्ञा, शीला, र समाधि । 

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।

यो संसारमा सबै क्षणिक छ र नश्वर छ। केही पनि स्थायी छैन। तर वेदिक मतबाट विरोध छ।

आत्मा नामको कुनै स्थायी चीज छैन । जसलाई मानिसहरू आत्मा सम्झन्छन, त्यो चेतनाको अविच्छिन्न प्रवाह छ।

बुद्धको धर्मको उद्देश्य दुःखबाट मुक्ति पाउने हो। यो धर्ममा ईश्वरको अस्तित्त्वको बारेमा मौन छ। ईश्वर भएको/नभएको तथा संसार कसले बनाए भन्ने विषयमा विवेचना गर्नाले मानिस लगायत सबै प्राणीका दुःख नघट्ने धारणा यो धर्ममा रहेको छ।

शून्यता महायान बौद्ध संप्रदायको प्रधान दर्शन हो।

बुद्ध धर्ममा संघको ठुलो महत्त्व छ। यस धर्ममा बुद्ध, बुद्धको धर्म र बुद्धको संघलाई त्रिरत्नको रुपमा मानिने गरिन्छ। संघका नियमहरु विनयपिटकमा संग्रहित छन। अंगुत्तरनिकायको कलमसुत्तमा बुद्धले आफ्नो अनुभव अनुसार धर्म पालना गर्ने स्वतन्त्रता दिएका तथा बुद्धले धर्मका सानातिना नियमहरु परिवर्तन गर्न सकिने उपदेश दिएका हुनाले बुद्धको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात बुद्ध धर्ममा विभिन्न प्रकारका संघहरु स्थापित भए। यस्ता संघ तथा संघका शाखाहरुमा विनयपिटकका नियमको पालना, स्थानीय सांस्कृतिक प्रभाव तथा धर्मको निश्चित पक्षमा बढी केन्द्रित हुने आदि विषयमा भिन्न मत राख्दछन। संघमा नै आश्रित नभइकन बुद्ध धर्मलाई आध्यात्मिक रुपमा पालना गर्ने पनि परम्परा भएको देखिन्छ। ऐतिहासिक कालमा विभिन्न निकाय तथा संघहरु रहेतापनि वर्तमानमा प्रायःजसो संघहरु तीन महासंघको प्रभावमा रहेको पाइन्छ। यी संघहरु थेरवाद, महायान र बज्रयान हुन। थेरवादलाई भूलवश केही मानिसहरु हीनयान पनि भन्ने गर्दछन। तर, हीनयान वर्तमानमा अस्तित्त्वमा नरहेको एक बुद्ध धर्मको इकाइ हो भने थेरवाद बुद्ध धर्मका तीन मुख्य संघ मध्ये एक हो।



बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।


बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।

सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।


बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे ।

बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रुपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौं सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्त्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रुपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्त्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्त्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरुले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरुले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रुपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरुको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्त्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रुपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रुपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रुपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रुपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।
१. दुःख : यस दुनियामा सबै केही दुःख छ। जन्ममा, बूढो हुनेमा, रोगमा, मृत्युमा, प्रियतम भन्दा टाढा हुनमा, मन नपर्ने चीजहरू सहितमा, चाहिकोलाई न पाउनुमा, सबैमा दुःख छ । 
२. दुःख प्रारम्भ : तृष्णा, या चाहना, दुःखको कारण छ र फेरी सशरीर गरेर संसारलाई जारी रख्दछ । 
३. दुःख निरोध : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।
४. दुःख निरोधको मार्ग : तृष्णाबाट मुक्ति आर्य अष्टांग मार्गका अनुसार बाँच्नबाट पाएमा जान सक्दछ ।

प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।

प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौं शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्त्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रूपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रूपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रूपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रूपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।


बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रूपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार बर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य संघ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौँ सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्त्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो ।

प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरुमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौँ शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरुमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरुले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरुको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्त्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रूपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रूपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरुको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रूपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रूपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।

गौतम बुद्धबाट पाएको ज्ञानतालाई बोधि भनिन्छ । मानिन्छ कि बोधि पाए पछि नैं संसारबाट छुटकारा पाइनछ । सारा पारमिताहरू (पूर्णताहरू)को निष्पत्ति, चार आर्य सत्यहरूको सारा सोच, र कर्मका निरोधबाट नैं बोधि पाएर जान सकिन्छ । त्यस समय, लोभ, दोष, मोह, अविद्या, तृष्णा, र आत्मांमा विश्वास सबै गायब भएर जान्छन् । बोधिका तीन स्तर हुन्छन्: श्रावकबोधि, प्रत्येकबोधि, र सम्यकसंबोधि। सम्यकसंबोधि बौध धर्मको सबै भन्दा उन्नत आदर्श मानिन्छ ।


बुद्ध धर्म एक अनिश्वरवादी धर्म हो। ऐतिहासिक रूपमा यो धर्म शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध (गौतम बुद्ध) र उनका अनुयायीहरुका शिक्षामा आधारित धर्म हो। बुद्ध धर्मको परम्परामा भने गौतम बुद्धलाई वर्तमान कल्पको चौथो सम्यक सम्बुद्धको रूपमा मानिन्छ । उनी छैंटौं देखि पाँचौं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व सम्म जीवित थिए । उनी बितेको अर्को पाँच शताब्दीहरूमा बौद्ध धर्म सारा भारतीय उपमहाद्वीपमा फैलियो, र अर्को दुई हजार वर्षहरूमा मध्य, पूर्वी र दक्षिण-पूर्वी जम्बू महाद्वीपमा पनि फैलिन गयो । आज, बौद्ध धर्ममा तीन मुख्य सङ्घ छन्: थेरवाद, महायान र वज्रयान। बौद्ध धर्मलाई पैंतीस करोड भन्दा अधिक मानिसहरू मान्दछन् र यो दुनियाको चौथो सबैभन्दा ठूलो धर्मको रूपमा रहेको छ ।

बुद्ध भन्नाले बोधिप्राप्त वा अन्तिम सत्यको साक्षात्कार गरेको महामानव बुझिन्छ। जो व्यक्ति आफ्नै प्रयासले विना गुरु बुद्धत्व प्राप्त गर्दछन् र अरू प्राणीहरूलाई दु:खनिरोधको मार्गदर्शन गर्दछन् उनलाई सम्यक सम्बुद्ध भनिन्छ । भनिन्छ कि गौतम बुद्धभन्दा अघि अनेक सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भइसके र भविष्यमा पनि अनेकौँ सम्यक सम्बुद्धहरू उत्पन्न भई दु:खनिरोधको सनातन शिक्षा दिनेछन । बौद्ध धर्मको अन्तिम लक्ष्य हो दुःखबाट सदाका लागि मुक्ति । बुद्धले दु:खमुक्तिसँग सरोकार नराख्ने दार्शनिक प्रश्नहरूलाई महत्त्व दिदैंनथे । उनी भन्दथे, "भिक्षुहरू म केवल एउटा कुरा मात्र सिकाउंछु: दु:ख र दु:खनिरोधको उपाय ।" शीलको जगमा रहेर ध्यानद्वारा समाधि पुष्ट गर्दै पज्ञा उत्पन्न् गराउन सकेमा नै दु:खमुक्तिको अवस्था निर्वाणको साक्षात्कार गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने उनको मूल शिक्षा हो । 

लुम्बिनी भगवान गौतम बुद्धको पवित्र जन्मस्थल हो । इ.पू.६२३ मा यहाँको सुन्दर र पवित्र बगैंचामा माता मायादेवीका कोखबाट बुद्ध धर्मका प्रणेता शान्तिका अग्रदुत भगवान गौतम बुद्धको जन्म भएको थियो उनले जन्मने बित्तिकै सात पाइला हिंड्दै मनुष्य जातिका लागि यसै ठाउँबाट युगान्तकारी उद्गार प्रकट गरेका थिए । यो पावनभूमी अहिले संसारभरिका बौद्धमार्गी लगायत शान्तिप्रेमी सबै मानिसहरु बीच विश्व शान्तिको मुहानका रूपमा प्रसिद्ध छ । सन् १९९७ देखि यो स्थल विश्व सम्पदा सूचीमा समेत सूचिकृत गरिएको छ । हरेक वर्ष संसारभरबाट लाखौंको संख्यामा तिर्थालु पर्यटकहरु तथा अध्ययेताहरु लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्छन् ।

विश्वभरका बौद्ध धर्मावलम्बीहरुका लागि लुम्बिनी अत्यन्त महत्त्वपूर्ण तिर्थस्थल हो । मायादेवी र भगवान बुद्धप्रति अगाध आस्था राख्ने भएकाले हिन्दुहरु समेतको लागि लुम्बिनी महत्त्वपूर्ण धार्मिक गन्तव्य बनेको छ । लुम्बिनीमा रहेका पुरातात्विक तथा ऐतिहासिक अवशेषहरूले शताब्दिऔं देखि विभिन्न व्यक्तित्वहरूले लुम्बिनीको तिर्थाटन गरेका तथ्यहरु उजागर गर्दछन् । प्रसिद्धमौर्य सम्राट अशोकले आफ्नो आध्यामिक गुरु उपगुप्तको मार्ग दर्शनमा इ.पु.२४९ मा लुम्बिनीको तिर्थ यात्रा गरेका थिए । उनले “हिंद बुधे जाते शाक्यमुनीति” (यहाँ शाक्यमुनि बुद्ध जन्मनु भएको थियो) भन्ने शिलालेख सहितको ढुङ्गाको स्तम्भ खडा गरे जसलाई हालत प्रसिद्ध अशोक पिल्लाराका रूपमा लुम्बिनीमा पाउन सकिन्छ । सम्राट अशोकले सिद्धार्थ गौतम जन्मनु भएको यही अवस्थिति चिनाउने स्मारकशिला र जन्मेपछि उहाँलाई शुद्धिकरणका लागि नुहाइएको पवित्र पोखरीको पूजा गरे । साथै उनले कपिलवस्तु, रामग्राम, देवदह जस्ता ऐतिहासिक ठाउँहरूको भ्रमण समेत गरे । 
प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरूमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौँ शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरूमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरूले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
पछि सन् १८९६ मा पाल्पाली गभर्नर जनरल खड्ग शम्शेर र अंग्रेज भारतका पुरातात्विक सर्भेयर एलोइस फुहररले अशोक स्तम्भ पुनः पत्ता लगाएपछि लुम्बिनी फेरी चासो र सरोकारको विषय बन्यो । सन् १९९९ मा पि.सि. मुखर्जीले भगवान बुद्धको जन्मस्थलमा उत्खनन् गरी मायादेवीको मूर्ति पहिचान गर्नुका साथै मन्दिरका केही भग्नावशेषहरु बाहिर देखाए । फेरि सन् १९३० को दशकमा केशर शम्शेर राणाले मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन् गरे । भारतीय पुरातत्वविद् श्रीमती देवला मित्राले सन् १९६२ मा अन्वेषणको कार्य गरिन् ।
सन् १९६० को दशकदेखि भने संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका साथै विभिन्न राष्ट्रिय अत्नर्राष्ट्रिय संघसंस्थाहरूको समेत सहयोग र सहकार्यमा नेपाल सरकारले विशेष महत्त्वका साथ विभिन्न निकायहरु निर्माण गरी लुम्बिनीको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र सम्वद्र्धनमा नेतृत्वदायी भूमिका खेल्दै आएको छ । सन् १९७० मा भवन तथा भौतिक योजना विभाग अन्तर्गत लुम्बिनी विकास परियोजना र सन् १९७५ मा लुम्बिनी विकास समितिको गठन गरी लुम्बिनीको जिम्मेवारी दिइएको थियो । १९८५ देखि स्वायत निकायका रूपमा लुम्बिनी विकास कोषको गठन भए पश्चात् लुम्बिनी क्षेत्रको उत्खनन्, संरक्षण र प्रवर्द्धनको काम कोषले नै गर्दै आएको छ । सन् १९९२ देखि १९९६ सम्म कोष, नेपाल सरकार पुरातत्व विभाग र जापान बौद्ध महासंघले संयुक्त रूपमा मायादेवी मन्दिर परिसरमा उत्खनन कार्य गरेका थिए । हाल लुम्बिनी विश्वभरका लाखौं मानिसहरूको धार्मिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा पर्यटकीय गन्तव्यका रूपमा स्थापित भइसकेको र सुन्दर, शान्त वाटिकाका रूपमा विकसित हुँदै गइरहेको छ ।

प्राप्त ऐतिहासिक तथ्यहरका आधारमा सम्राट अशोकपछि लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गर्नेहरूमा चिनियाँ यात्रीहरु त्सेङ साई, पायिहयान र हुयेन साड्ड थिए । त्सेङ साईले चौथो शताब्दीमा, फाहियानले पाँचौ शताब्दीमा र हुयेन साड्डले सातौँ शताब्दीमा लुम्बिनीको भ्रमण गरेका थिए । यी यात्रीहरूमा हुयेन साड्डको यात्रा विवरणहरूले लुम्बिनीको बारेमा बिस्तृत विवरणहरु दिन्छन् । उनले लुम्बिनीमा जन्मबृक्षको ठूटो, एउटा चैत्य, अशोक स्तम्भ, पवित्र पोखरी, तेलार नदी, चिसो र तातो पानीका मुहानहरु भएको कुवा देखेको उल्लेख गरेका छन् । सन् १३१२ मा पश्चिम नेपाल कर्णाली क्षेत्रका राजा रिपु मल्लले लुीम्बनीको भ्रमण गरी आफ्नो यात्राको स्मरण गराउन अशोक स्तम्भमा “ॐ मणि पद्मे हुङ रिपु मल्ल चिर जयतु” भनी लेखे । त्यसपछि भने इतिहासको लामो कालसम्म लुम्बिनी विस्मृतिमा रहन पुग्यो ।
