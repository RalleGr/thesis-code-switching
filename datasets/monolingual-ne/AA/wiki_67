Dermatology (from Greek "derma," "skin") is a branch of medicine dealing with the skin and its appendages (hair, nails, sweat glands etc). A medical doctor who specializes in dermatology is a dermatologist.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and tumors of the skin and its appendages. There are medical and surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy and liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses and treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis and management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college and post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States and Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written and oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) and dermatological immunology.

Training program in Australia

An Australian specialist dermatologist will have completed 6 years of medical school, one internship year and at least one year of general medical or surgical service in the public hospital system, prior to becoming eligible for specialist training in dermatology. The selection process is rigorous and transparent; candidates must pass science and pharmacology exams and engage in monitored and assessed practical training in medical and surgical dermatology. At the completion of the 5 year training programme, trainees sit a national written examination held over two days. Successful candidates may then proceed to the practical viva examination (held over 2 days) after which they may apply for fellowship status with the Australian College of Dermatologists.

To be a dermatologist in India, a minimum of 3 years of training is required after graduation from medical school and internship. The period involves rigorous training in all aspects of general dermatology, cosmetic dermatology, venereal diseases (including HIV) and leprosy. At the end of the training period the resident has to go through written tests and clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree vvawarded is MD (dermatology, venereology and leprosy). Most specialists also go for certification by the national board (for the award of 'diplomate of national board').

The skin is the largest organ of the body and obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms and signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases and endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses and treats sexually transmitted diseases, and phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, and dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring and fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development and safe and effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen and hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, and chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting and educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), and a variety of topical and injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer and hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious and life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination and a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration and temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams and clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light and preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion and visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions and symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen and help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema and psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers and injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics and immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris and often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

From the basic science of cutaneous genetics and immunology, to the practical application of new knowledge and technology in the diagnosis and management of skin disease (like psoriasis) and surgical treatment of skin cancer, dermatologists have been among the leaders in the field. The annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology is one of the keys for rapid dissemination of new knowledge to the practicing dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), and a variety of topical and injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer and hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious and life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination and a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration and temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams and clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light and preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion and visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions and symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen and help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema and psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers and injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics and immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris and often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

From the basic science of cutaneous genetics and immunology, to the practical application of new knowledge and technology in the diagnosis and management of skin disease (like psoriasis) and surgical treatment of skin cancer, dermatologists have been among the leaders in the field. The annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology is one of the keys for rapid dissemination of new knowledge to the practicing dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon.




Dermatology (from Greek "derma," "skin") is a branch of medicine dealing with the skin and its appendages (hair, nails, sweat glands etc). A medical doctor who specializes in dermatology is a dermatologist.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and tumors of the skin and its appendages. There are medical and surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy and liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses and treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis and management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college and post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States and Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written and oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) and dermatological immunology.

Training program in Australia

An Australian specialist dermatologist will have completed 6 years of medical school, one internship year and at least one year of general medical or surgical service in the public hospital system, prior to becoming eligible for specialist training in dermatology. The selection process is rigorous and transparent; candidates must pass science and pharmacology exams and engage in monitored and assessed practical training in medical and surgical dermatology. At the completion of the 5 year training programme, trainees sit a national written examination held over two days. Successful candidates may then proceed to the practical viva examination (held over 2 days) after which they may apply for fellowship status with the Australian College of Dermatologists.

To be a dermatologist in India, a minimum of 3 years of training is required after graduation from medical school and internship. The period involves rigorous training in all aspects of general dermatology, cosmetic dermatology, venereal diseases (including HIV) and leprosy. At the end of the training period the resident has to go through written tests and clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams.

The degree clinical exams. The degree vvawarded is MD (dermatology, venereology and leprosy). Most specialists also go for certification by the national board (for the award of 'diplomate of national board').

The skin is the largest organ of the body and obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms and signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases and endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses and treats sexually transmitted diseases, and phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, and dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring and fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development and safe and effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen and hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, and chemical peeling.

The skin is the largest organ of the body र obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms र signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis र tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases र endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses र treats sexually transmitted diseases, र phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, र dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring र fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development र safe र effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen र hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, र chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting र educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), र a variety of topical र injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer र hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious र life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination र a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration र temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams र clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light र preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion र visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions र symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen र help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema र psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers र injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics र immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris र often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

From the basic science of cutaneous genetics र immunology, to the practical application of new knowledge र technology in the diagnosis र management of skin disease (like psoriasis) र surgical treatment of skin cancer, dermatologists have been among the leaders in the field. The annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology is one of the keys for rapid dissemination of new knowledge to the practicing dermatologist र dermatologic surgeon.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis र treatment of diseases र tumors of the skin र its appendages. There are medical र surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) र cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy र liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses र treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis र management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college र post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States र Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written र oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) र dermatological immunology.

Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses र treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis र management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college र post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States र Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written र oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) र dermatological immunology.

Training program in Australia

An Australian specialist dermatologist will have completed 6 years of medical school, one internship year र at least one year of general medical or surgical service in the public hospital system, prior to becoming eligible for specialist training in dermatology. The selection process is rigorous र transparent; candidates must pass science र pharmacology exams र engage in monitored र assessed practical training in medical र surgical dermatology. At the completion of the 5 year training programme, trainees sit a national written examination held over two days. Successful candidates may then proceed to the practical viva examination (held over 2 days) after which they may apply for fellowship status with the Australian College of Dermatologists.

To be a dermatologist in India, a minimum of 3 years of training is required after graduation from medical school र internship. The period involves rigorous training in all aspects of general dermatology, cosmetic dermatology, venereal diseases (including HIV) र leprosy. At the end of the training period the resident has to go through written tests र clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams.

The degree clinical exams. The degree vvawarded is MD (dermatology, venereology र leprosy). Most specialists also go for certification by the national board (for the award of 'diplomate of national board').

The skin is the largest organ of the body र obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms र signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis र tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases र endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses र treats sexually transmitted diseases, र phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, र dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring र fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development र safe र effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen र hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, र chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting र educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), र a variety of topical र injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer र hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious र life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination र a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration र temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams र clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light र preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion र visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions र symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen र help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema र psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers र injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics र immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris र often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

From the basic science of cutaneous genetics र immunology, to the practical application of new knowledge र technology in the diagnosis र management of skin disease (like psoriasis) र surgical treatment of skin cancer, dermatologists have been among the leaders in the field. The annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology is one of the keys for rapid dissemination of new knowledge to the practicing dermatologist र dermatologic surgeon.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema र psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers र injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics र immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris र often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis र treatment of diseases र tumors of the skin र its appendages. There are medical र surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) र cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy र liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses र treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis र management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college र post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States र Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written र oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) र dermatological immunology.

Training program in Australia

An Australian specialist dermatologist will have completed 6 years of medical school, one internship year र at least one year of general medical or surgical service in the public hospital system, prior to becoming eligible for specialist training in dermatology. The selection process is rigorous र transparent; candidates must pass science र pharmacology exams र engage in monitored र assessed practical training in medical र surgical dermatology. At the completion of the 5 year training programme, trainees sit a national written examination held over two days. Successful candidates may then proceed to the practical viva examination (held over 2 days) after which they may apply for fellowship status with the Australian College of Dermatologists.

To be a dermatologist in India, a minimum of 3 years of training is required after graduation from medical school र internship. The period involves rigorous training in all aspects of general dermatology, cosmetic dermatology, venereal diseases (including HIV) र leprosy. At the end of the training period the resident has to go through written tests र clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree vvawarded is MD (dermatology, venereology र leprosy). Most specialists also go for certification by the national board (for the award of 'diplomate of national board').

The skin is the largest organ of the body र obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms र signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis र tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases र endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses र treats sexually transmitted diseases, र phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, र dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring र fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development र safe र effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen र hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, र chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting र educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), र a variety of topical र injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer र hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious र life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination र a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration र temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams र clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light र preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion र visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions र symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen र help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development र safe र effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen र hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, र chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting र educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), र a variety of topical र injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer र hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious र life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination र a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration र temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams र clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light र preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion र visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions र symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen र help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema र psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers र injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics र immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris र often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

From the basic science of cutaneous genetics र immunology, to the practical application of new knowledge र technology in the diagnosis र management of skin disease (like psoriasis) र surgical treatment of skin cancer, dermatologists have been among the leaders in the field. The annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology is one of the keys for rapid dissemination of new knowledge to the practicing dermatologist र dermatologic surgeon.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis र treatment of diseases र tumors of the skin र its appendages. There are medical र surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) र cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy र liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses र treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis र management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college र post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States र Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written र oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) र dermatological immunology.

Training program in Australia

An Australian specialist dermatologist will have completed 6 years of medical school, one internship year र at least one year of general medical or surgical service in the public hospital system, prior to becoming eligible for specialist training in dermatology. The selection process is rigorous र transparent; candidates must pass science र pharmacology exams र engage in monitored र assessed practical training in medical र surgical dermatology. At the completion of the 5 year training programme, trainees sit a national written examination held over two days. Successful candidates may then proceed to the practical viva examination (held over 2 days) after which they may apply for fellowship status with the Australian College of Dermatologists.

To be a dermatologist in India, a minimum of 3 years of training is required after graduation from medical school र internship.

The skin is the largest organ of the body र obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms र signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis र tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases र endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) र dermatological immunology.

Training program in Australia

An Australian specialist dermatologist will have completed 6 years of medical school, one internship year र at least one year of general medical or surgical service in the public hospital system, prior to becoming eligible for specialist training in dermatology. The selection process is rigorous र transparent; candidates must pass science र pharmacology exams र engage in monitored र assessed practical training in medical र surgical dermatology. At the completion of the 5 year training programme, trainees sit a national written examination held over two days. Successful candidates may then proceed to the practical viva examination (held over 2 days) after which they may apply for fellowship status with the Australian College of Dermatologists.

To be a dermatologist in India, a minimum of 3 years of training is required after graduation from medical school र internship. The period involves rigorous training in all aspects of general dermatology, cosmetic dermatology, venereal diseases (including HIV) र leprosy. At the end of the training period the resident has to go through written tests र clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams.

Most specialists also go for certification by the national board (for the award of 'diplomate of national board').

The skin is the largest organ of the body र obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms र signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis र tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases र endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses र treats sexually transmitted diseases, र phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, र dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring र fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development र safe र effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen र hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, र chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting र educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), र a variety of topical र injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer र hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious र life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination र a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration र temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams र clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light र preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion र visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions र symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen र help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema र psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers र injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics र immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris र often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

From the basic science of cutaneous genetics र immunology, to the practical application of new knowledge र technology in the diagnosis र management of skin disease (like psoriasis) र surgical treatment of skin cancer, dermatologists have been among the leaders in the field. The annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology is one of the keys for rapid dissemination of new knowledge to the practicing dermatologist र dermatologic surgeon.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis र treatment of diseases र tumors of the skin र its appendages. There are medical र surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) र cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy र liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses र treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis र management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college र post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States र Canada.

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis र treatment of diseases र tumors of the skin र its appendages. There are medical र surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) र cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy र liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses र treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis र management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college र post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States र Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written र oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) र dermatological immunology.

Training program in Australia

An Australian specialist dermatologist will have completed 6 years of medical school, one internship year र at least one year of general medical or surgical service in the public hospital system, prior to becoming eligible for specialist training in dermatology. The selection process is rigorous र transparent; candidates must pass science र pharmacology exams र engage in monitored र assessed practical training in medical र surgical dermatology. At the completion of the 5 year training programme, trainees sit a national written examination held over two days. Successful candidates may then proceed to the practical viva examination (held over 2 days) after which they may apply for fellowship status with the Australian College of Dermatologists.

To be a dermatologist in India, a minimum of 3 years of training is required after graduation from medical school र internship. The period involves rigorous training in all aspects of general dermatology, cosmetic dermatology, venereal diseases (including HIV) र leprosy. At the end of the training period the resident has to go through written tests र clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree vvawarded is MD (dermatology, venereology र leprosy). Most specialists also go for certification by the national board (for the award of 'diplomate of national board').

The skin is the largest organ of the body र obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms र signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis र tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases र endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses र treats sexually transmitted diseases, र phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, र dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring र fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development र safe र effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen र hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, र chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting र educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), र a variety of topical र injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer र hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious र life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination र a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration र temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams र clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light र preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion र visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions र symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen र help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema र psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers र injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics र immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris र often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious र life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination र a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration र temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams र clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light र preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion र visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions र symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen र help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema र psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers र injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics र immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris र often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

From the basic science of cutaneous genetics र immunology, to the practical application of new knowledge र technology in the diagnosis र management of skin disease (like psoriasis) र surgical treatment of skin cancer, dermatologists have been among the leaders in the field. The annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology is one of the keys for rapid dissemination of new knowledge to the practicing dermatologist र dermatologic surgeon.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis र treatment of diseases र tumors of the skin र its appendages. There are medical र surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) र cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy र liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses र treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis र management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college र post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States र Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written र oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) र dermatological immunology.

The skin is the largest organ of the body र obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms र signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis र tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases र endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses र treats sexually transmitted diseases, र phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, र dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring र fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development र safe र effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen र hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, र chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician.

The skin is the largest organ of the body र obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms र signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis र tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases र endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses र treats sexually transmitted diseases, र phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, र dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring र fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development र safe र effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen र hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, र chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting र educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), र a variety of topical र injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer र hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious र life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination र a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration र temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams र clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light र preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion र visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions र symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen र help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema र psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers र injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics र immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris र often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

From the basic science of cutaneous genetics र immunology, to the practical application of new knowledge र technology in the diagnosis र management of skin disease (like psoriasis) र surgical treatment of skin cancer, dermatologists have been among the leaders in the field. The annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology is one of the keys for rapid dissemination of new knowledge to the practicing dermatologist र dermatologic surgeon.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis र treatment of diseases र tumors of the skin र its appendages. There are medical र surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) र cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy र liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses र treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis र management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college र post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States र Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written र oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) र dermatological immunology.

Dermatologists are physicians (medical doctors) specializing in the diagnosis र treatment of diseases र tumors of the skin र its appendages. There are medical र surgical sides to the specialty. Dermatologic surgeons practice skin cancer surgery (including Mohs' micrographic surgery), laser surgery, photodynamic therapy (PDT) र cosmetic procedures using botulinum toxin ('Botox'), soft tissue fillers, sclerotherapy र liposuction. Dermatopathologists interpret tissue under the microscope (histopathology). Pediatric dermatologists specialize in the diagnoses र treatment of skin disease in children. Immunodermatologists specialize in the diagnosis र management of skin diseases driven by an altered immune system including blistering (bullous) diseases like pemphigus. In addition, there are a wide range of congenital syndromes managed by dermatologists.

A minimum of 12 years of college र post graduate training is required to become a dermatologist in the United States र Canada. This includes graduation from a 4-year college, a 4-year medical school followed by a year of post graduate training in medicine, surgery or pediatrics (called an internship) after which a physician may apply for admission to graduate dermatology residency training. Dermatology residencies are among the most competitive. Following the successful completion of formal residency training in dermatology (3 years) the physician is qualified to take certifying board examinations (written र oral) by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Once board certified, dermatologists become Diplomates of the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology AOCD. They are then eligible to apply for fellowship status in the American Academy of Dermatology. Some dermatologists undertake advanced subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completion of their residency training. These fellowships are either one or two years in duration. Fellowships in dermatology include pediatric dermatology, surgical dermatology including MOHS micrographic surgery, dermatopathology (pathology of skin diseases) र dermatological immunology.

Training program in Australia

An Australian specialist dermatologist will have completed 6 years of medical school, one internship year र at least one year of general medical or surgical service in the public hospital system, prior to becoming eligible for specialist training in dermatology. The selection process is rigorous र transparent; candidates must pass science र pharmacology exams र engage in monitored र assessed practical training in medical र surgical dermatology. At the completion of the 5 year training programme, trainees sit a national written examination held over two days. Successful candidates may then proceed to the practical viva examination (held over 2 days) after which they may apply for fellowship status with the Australian College of Dermatologists.

To be a dermatologist in India, a minimum of 3 years of training is required after graduation from medical school र internship. The period involves rigorous training in all aspects of general dermatology, cosmetic dermatology, venereal diseases (including HIV) र leprosy. At the end of the training period the resident has to go through written tests र clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree clinical exams. The degree vvawarded is MD (dermatology, venereology र leprosy). Most specialists also go for certification by the national board (for the award of 'diplomate of national board').

The skin is the largest organ of the body र obviously the most visible. Although many skin diseases are isolated, some are manifestations of internal disease. Hence, a dermatologist is schooled in aspects of surgery, rheumatology (many rheumatic diseases can feature skin symptoms र signs), immunology, neurology (the "neurocuteaneous syndromes", such as neurofibromatosis र tuberous sclerosis), infectious diseases र endocrinology. The study of genetics is also becoming increasingly important.

Venereology, the subspecialty that diagnoses र treats sexually transmitted diseases, र phlebology, the specialty that deals with problems of the superficial venous system, are both part of a dermatologist's expertise.

Cosmetic dermatology has long been an important part of the field, र dermatologists have been the primary innovators in this area. In the 1900's dermatologists employed dermabrasion to improve acne scarring र fat microtransfer was used to fill in cutaneous defects. More recently, dermatologists have been the driving force behind the development र safe र effective employment of lasers, new dermal filling agents (collagen र hyaluronic acid), botulinum toxin ("Botox"), nonablative laser rejuvenation procedures, intense pulsed light systems, photodynamic therapy, र chemical peeling.

Dermatologic surgery (sometimes referred to as "Dermosurgery") is surgery performed by a dermatologipt physician. A dermatologic surgeon (sometimes known as a "Dermasurgeon") is a dermatologist with a special interest in this field who has applied for fellowship status in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, a professional organization dedicated to supporting र educating these physicians.

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), र a variety of topical र injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer र hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained dermatologic surgeons perform Mohs cancer surgery, which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.

Any mole that is irregular in color or shape should be examined by a dermatologist to determine if it is a malignant melanoma, the most serious र life-threatening form of skin cancer. Following a visual examination र a dermatoscopic exam (an invaluable new instrument that illuminates a mole without reflected light), a dermatologist may biopsy a suspicious mole. If it is malignant, it will be excised in the dermatologist's office.

The first step of any contact with a physician is the medical history. In order to classify a cutaneous eruption, the dermatologist will ask detailed questions on the duration र temporal pattern of skin problems, itching or pain, relation to food intake, sunlight, over-the-counter creams र clothing. When an underlying disease is suspected, an additional detailed history of related symptoms will be elicited (such as arthritis in a suspected case of lupus erythematosus).

Dermatology has the obvious benefit of having easy access to tissue for diagnosis. Physical examination is generally done under bright light र preferably involves the whole body. At this stage, the doctor may apply Wood's light, which may aid in diagnosing types of mycosis or demonstrate the extent of pigmented lesions, or use a dermatoscope which enlarges a suspected lesion र visualizes it without reflected light. The dermatoscope is helpful in differentiating a benign naevus from melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis from a mole. A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is important in the diagnosis of dermatological disorders. Dermatologic diagnosis is often dependent upon pattern recognition of lesions र symptoms.

Culture or Gram staining of suspected infectious lesions may identify a pathogen र help direct therapy.

If the diagnosis is uncertain or a cutaneous malignancy is suspected, the dermatologic surgeon may perform a small punch biopsy (using a local anesthetic) for examination under the microscope by the dermatologist who is a trained dermatopathologist.

The skin is obviously accessible to topical local therapy. Antibiotic creams can help eliminate infections, while inflammatory skin diseases (such as eczema र psoriasis) often respond to steroid creams or topical anthralin. Dermatologists are innovators of new immune enhancing treatments, like topical imiquimod for superficial cancers र injection immunotherapy for warts as discussed below.

Topical medications treat many dermatological diseases, but dermatologists also use oral medications. Antibiotics र immune suppressants or immune enhancing agents (injection immunotherapy or topical imiquimod) for dermatological diseases or tumors. Isotretinoin ("Accutane") is used for severe cystic acne vulgaris र often produces a life-time remission of this disfiguring disease. Isotretinoin prescribing in the U.S. is now controlled by a cumbersome FDA governmental website called iPLEDGE. Various new modalities of treatment are in the foray, with the advent of laser technology things are quite promising.

Photomedicine involves the use of ultraviolet light, often in combination with oral or topical agents, to treat skin disease (eg. psoriasis or mycosis fungoides).

Surgical intervention by a dermatologic surgeon may be necessary, for example, to treat varicose veins or skin cancer. Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy (injecting an agent that obliterates the vein) or the long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Skin cancers can be managed with excision (including Mohs cancer surgery), cryosurgery, x-ray, or with the recent topical immune enhancing agent imiquimod. above section on "Dermatologic Surgery" for more details.

आकस्मिक चिकित्सा

Emergency medicine is a branch of medicine that is practiced in a hospital emergency department, in the field (in a modified form - see EMS), and other locations where initial medical treatment of illness takes place.

Emergency medicine focuses on diagnosis and treatment of acute illnesses and injuries that require immediate care. While not usually providing long-term care, EM physicians and pre-hospital personnel still provide care with the aim of improving long-term patient outcome. In the United States, some people use the emergency department for outpatient care that could be provided at a doctor's office. As a result, much of emergency room care is general practice (coughs, colds, aches, pains). 

A variant of an Emergency Department is an Urgent Care Center, often staffed by non-Emergency Medicine trained physicians and/or nurses, which treats patients who desire or require immediate care, but do not reach the acuity that requires care in an emergency department. 

Emergency Medicine involves a large amount of general medicine but involves all fields of medicine including the surgical sub-specialties. Emergency Physicians are tasked with seeing a large number of patients, treating their illnesses and admitting them to the hospital as necessary. The field requires a broad field of knowledge and requires advance procedural skills often including surgical procedures, trauma resuscitation, advance cardiac life support and advanced airway management.

"Emergency medicine is a field of practice based on the knowledge and skills required for the prevention, diagnosis and management of acute and urgent aspects of illness and injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical and behavioural disorders. It further encompasses an understanding of the development of pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency medical systems and the skills necessary for this development."

International Federation for Emergency Medicine 1991
Emergency Medicine as a standalone medical specialty is relatively young. Prior to the 1960's and 70's, hospital emergency rooms were generally staffed by doctors trained in other specialties, such as internal medicine and primary care. However, during this time period, groups of physicians mostly located in the midwestern United States (notably Cincinnati, Ohio, and Denver, Colorado) recognized the need, and the niche, for physicians specifically trained to handle acute medical emergencies.
In the United States, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) is presently the largest member organization of emergency physicians (EPs), and is open to most physicians who practice in an Emergency Department. Originally founded in 1968, it was the first Emergency Medicine society formed in the United States. Fellows use the designation FACEP. 

The American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians (ACOEP) was founded seven years later in 1975. Membership is open to both osteopathic (D.O.) and allopathic (M.D.) physicians who practice emergency medicine. Fellows use the designation FACOEP.

The American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) is another specialty society of Emergency Medicine. It was formed after ACEP and ACOEP and is considered a rival organization although both organizations have cooperated in the past. Members must be board certified in Emergency Medicine. Fellows use the designation FAAEM. 

The American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care (ACVECC) is the governing body that offers board-certification to veterinarians who have completed an accredited residency program and passed a rigorous written, practical and oral certification examination. Specialists are known as criticalists, and most are employed in referral practice or academic institutions. It is a rapidly expanding field of veterinary medicine. Specialists are given the desgination of DACVECC after becoming certified for Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care.

The American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) provides board certification to allopathic (M.D.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional year of practice, passed a written exam, and then an oral exam. 

The American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine (AOBEM) provides board certification to osteopathic (D.O.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional two years of practice, passed a written exam, and passed an oral exam. 

The American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) also offers Board Certification in Emergency Medicine (BCEM). This certification is offered to experienced physicians who have completed residency training in related primary care fields, who have more than 5 years of full-time emergency medicine experience, are certified in ACLS/PALS/ATLS courses, provide letters of recommendation, and file 10 case reports - all required prior to passing both written and oral tests. The ABPS certification is more widely recognized in rural and suburban hospitals. The 'grandfathering-in' of other experienced non-residency trained physicians practicing emergency medicine was closed off from ABEM and AOBEM several years ago, likewise from BCEM if the doctor has not completed a residency. Currently (as of 7/06), only the state of Florida has recognized BCEM at the state medical board level, but many hospitals across the country do recognize BCEM. 

Board certification is maintained through annual testing over required reading lists and a more extensive written exam every 10 years (for ABEM), every 8 years for BCEM. 

Many types of physicians may practice in an Emerency Department; however, only those who have successfully passed the board certification process are considered "Emergency Medicine Specialists". Currently the ABEM and AOBEM require a number of years of residency training after medical school, followed by comprehensive written and oral examinations. The BCEM requires (in addition to passing written and oral examinations) completion of an ACGME approved residency in an approved specialty such as Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, 5 years of the practice of emergency medicine, 10 Peer reviewed case reports, current ATLS/PALS/ACLS certification and 3 letters of recommendation from peers. 

A sudden surge of interest in the specialty in the late 1990s was due to the popularity of the American TV series ER. Showcasing the function of a Chicago Emergency Department (loosely based on Cook County Hospital) and its many characters, the show introduced a large number of people to the specialty. 

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the College of Emergency Medicine sets the examinations that trainees in Emergency Medicine take in order to become consultants (fully-trained emergency physicians). The British Association for Emergency Medicine is the member organization in the UK. In 2005, the two organisations initiated steps to merge as the College of Emergency Medicine.

In Australia and New Zealand, advanced training in Emergency Medicine is overseen by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM).

In Canada, there are two routes to practice emergency medicine. More than two thirds of physicians currently practicing emergency medicine across the nation have no specific emergency medicine residency training. Emergency physicians who tend to work in more community-based settings complete a residency specializing in Family Medicine and then proceed to obtain an additional year of training of special competence on Emergency Medicine from the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CCFP-EM). Physicians practicing in major urban/tertiary care hospitals will often pursue a 5 year specialist residency in Emergency Medicine, certified by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. These members typically spend a great deal of time in academic and leadership roles within emergency medicine, EMS, research, and other avenues. There is no significant difference in remuneration or clinical practice type between physicians certified by either route.

In the US, Emergency Medicine is one of the more competitive specialties to get into, and residency programs generally select physicians from the top of their medical school class. There are usually many physicians competing for each residency spot.

Allopathic (M.D.) emergency medicine residencies can be 3 or 4 years in length, combining both the internship and residency into one program or "1+3," utilizing a separate internship followed by 3 years of Emergency Medicine. Osteopathic (D.O.) residencies are four years in length, requiring a one year traditional rotating internship followed by a three-year emergency medicine residency. In addition to the didactic exposure, much of an emergency medicine residency involves rotating through other specialties with a majority of such rotations through the emergency department itself. By the end of their training, EPs are expected to handle a vast field of medical, surgical, and psychiatric emergencies. EPs are therefore both clinical generalists and well-rounded diagnosticians. EPs are considered specialists in advance cardiac life support protocols ('codes') and airway management.

The employment arrangement of emergency physician practices are either private (a democratic group of EPs staff an ED under contract), institutional (EPs with an independent contractor relationship with the hospital), or corporate (EPs with an independent contractor relationship with a third party staffing company that services multiple emergency departments). 

Most emergency physicians staff hospital emergency departments in shifts, a job structure necessitated by the 24/7 nature of the emergency department.



Emergency medicine is a branch of medicine that is practiced in a hospital emergency department, in the field (in a modified form - see EMS), and other locations where initial medical treatment of illness takes place.

Emergency medicine focuses on diagnosis and treatment of acute illnesses and injuries that require immediate care. While not usually providing long-term care, EM physicians and pre-hospital personnel still provide care with the aim of improving long-term patient outcome. In the United States, some people use the emergency department for outpatient care that could be provided at a doctor's office. As a result, much of emergency room care is general practice (coughs, colds, aches, pains). 

A variant of an Emergency Department is an Urgent Care Center, often staffed by non-Emergency Medicine trained physicians and/or nurses, which treats patients who desire or require immediate care, but do not reach the acuity that requires care in an emergency department. 

Emergency Medicine involves a large amount of general medicine but involves all fields of medicine including the surgical sub-specialties. Emergency Physicians are tasked with seeing a large number of patients, treating their illnesses and admitting them to the hospital as necessary. The field requires a broad field of knowledge and requires advance procedural skills often including surgical procedures, trauma resuscitation, advance cardiac life support and advanced airway management.

"Emergency medicine is a field of practice based on the knowledge and skills required for the prevention, diagnosis and management of acute and urgent aspects of illness and injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical and behavioural disorders. It further encompasses an understanding of the development of pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency medical systems and the skills necessary for this development."

Emergency Medicine as a standalone medical specialty is relatively young. Prior to the 1960's and 70's, hospital emergency rooms were generally staffed by doctors trained in other specialties, such as internal medicine and primary care. However, during this time period, groups of physicians mostly located in the midwestern United States (notably Cincinnati, Ohio, and Denver, Colorado) recognized the need, and the niche, for physicians specifically trained to handle acute medical emergencies.
In the United States, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) is presently the largest member organization of emergency physicians (EPs), and is open to most physicians who practice in an Emergency Department. Originally founded in 1968, it was the first Emergency Medicine society formed in the United States. Fellows use the designation FACEP. 

The American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians (ACOEP) was founded seven years later in 1975. Membership is open to both osteopathic (D.O.) and allopathic (M.D.) physicians who practice emergency medicine. Fellows use the designation FACOEP.

The American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) is another specialty society of Emergency Medicine. It was formed after ACEP and ACOEP and is considered a rival organization although both organizations have cooperated in the past. Members must be board certified in Emergency Medicine. Fellows use the designation FAAEM. 

The American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care (ACVECC) is the governing body that offers board-certification to veterinarians who have completed an accredited residency program and passed a rigorous written, practical and oral certification examination. Specialists are known as criticalists, and most are employed in referral practice or academic institutions. It is a rapidly expanding field of veterinary medicine. Specialists are given the desgination of DACVECC after becoming certified for Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care.

The American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) provides board certification to allopathic (M.D.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional year of practice, passed a written exam, and then an oral exam. 

The American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine (AOBEM) provides board certification to osteopathic (D.O.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional two years of practice, passed a written exam, and passed an oral exam. 

The American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) also offers Board Certification in Emergency Medicine (BCEM). This certification is offered to experienced physicians who have completed residency training in related primary care fields, who have more than 5 years of full-time emergency medicine experience, are certified in ACLS/PALS/ATLS courses, provide letters of recommendation, and file 10 case reports - all required prior to passing both written and oral tests. The ABPS certification is more widely recognized in rural and suburban hospitals. The 'grandfathering-in' of other experienced non-residency trained physicians practicing emergency medicine was closed off from ABEM and AOBEM several years ago, likewise from BCEM if the doctor has not completed a residency. Currently (as of 7/06), only the state of Florida has recognized BCEM at the state medical board level, but many hospitals across the country do recognize BCEM. 

Board certification is maintained through annual testing over required reading lists and a more extensive written exam every 10 years (for ABEM), every 8 years for BCEM. 

Many types of physicians may practice in an Emerency Department; however, only those who have successfully passed the board certification process are considered "Emergency Medicine Specialists". Currently the ABEM and AOBEM require a number of years of residency training after medical school, followed by comprehensive written and oral examinations. The BCEM requires (in addition to passing written and oral examinations) completion of an ACGME approved residency in an approved specialty such as Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, 5 years of the practice of emergency medicine, 10 Peer reviewed case reports, current ATLS/PALS/ACLS certification and 3 letters of recommendation from peers.

In Canada, there are two routes to practice emergency medicine. More than two thirds of physicians currently practicing emergency medicine across the nation have no specific emergency medicine residency training. Emergency physicians who tend to work in more community-based settings complete a residency specializing in Family Medicine र then proceed to obtain an additional year of training of special competence on Emergency Medicine from the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CCFP-EM). Physicians practicing in major urban/tertiary care hospitals will often pursue a 5 year specialist residency in Emergency Medicine, certified by the Royal College of Physicians र Surgeons of Canada. These members typically spend a great deal of time in academic र leadership roles within emergency medicine, EMS, research, र other avenues. There is no significant difference in remuneration or clinical practice type between physicians certified by either route.

In the US, Emergency Medicine is one of the more competitive specialties to get into, र residency programs generally select physicians from the top of their medical school class. There are usually many physicians competing for each residency spot.

Allopathic (M.D.) emergency medicine residencies can be 3 or 4 years in length, combining both the internship र residency into one program or "1+3," utilizing a separate internship followed by 3 years of Emergency Medicine. Osteopathic (D.O.) residencies are four years in length, requiring a one year traditional rotating internship followed by a three-year emergency medicine residency. In addition to the didactic exposure, much of an emergency medicine residency involves rotating through other specialties with a majority of such rotations through the emergency department itself. By the end of their training, EPs are expected to handle a vast field of medical, surgical, र psychiatric emergencies. EPs are therefore both clinical generalists र well-rounded diagnosticians. EPs are considered specialists in advance cardiac life support protocols ('codes') र airway management.

The employment arrangement of emergency physician practices are either private (a democratic group of EPs staff an ED under contract), institutional (EPs with an independent contractor relationship with the hospital), or corporate (EPs with an independent contractor relationship with a third party staffing company that services multiple emergency departments). 

Most emergency physicians staff hospital emergency departments in shifts, a job structure necessitated by the 24/7 nature of the emergency department.

Emergency medicine focuses on diagnosis र treatment of acute illnesses र injuries that require immediate care. While not usually providing long-term care, EM physicians र pre-hospital personnel still provide care with the aim of improving long-term patient outcome. In the United States, some people use the emergency department for outpatient care that could be provided at a doctor's office. As a result, much of emergency room care is general practice (coughs, colds, aches, pains). 

A variant of an Emergency Department is an Urgent Care Center, often staffed by non-Emergency Medicine trained physicians and/or nurses, which treats patients who desire or require immediate care, but do not reach the acuity that requires care in an emergency department. 

Emergency Medicine involves a large amount of general medicine but involves all fields of medicine including the surgical sub-specialties. Emergency Physicians are tasked with seeing a large number of patients, treating their illnesses र admitting them to the hospital as necessary. The field requires a broad field of knowledge र requires advance procedural skills often including surgical procedures, trauma resuscitation, advance cardiac life support र advanced airway management.

"Emergency medicine is a field of practice based on the knowledge र skills required for the prevention, diagnosis र management of acute र urgent aspects of illness र injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical र behavioural disorders.

Emergency Medicine as a standalone medical specialty is relatively young. Prior to the 1960's र 70's, hospital emergency rooms were generally staffed by doctors trained in other specialties, such as internal medicine र primary care. However, during this time period, groups of physicians mostly located in the midwestern United States (notably Cincinnati, Ohio, र Denver, Colorado) recognized the need, र the niche, for physicians specifically trained to handle acute medical emergencies.
In the United States, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) is presently the largest member organization of emergency physicians (EPs), र is open to most physicians who practice in an Emergency Department. Originally founded in 1968, it was the first Emergency Medicine society formed in the United States. Fellows use the designation FACEP. 

The American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians (ACOEP) was founded seven years later in 1975. Membership is open to both osteopathic (D.O.) र allopathic (M.D.) physicians who practice emergency medicine. Fellows use the designation FACOEP.

The American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) is another specialty society of Emergency Medicine. It was formed after ACEP र ACOEP र is considered a rival organization although both organizations have cooperated in the past. Members must be board certified in Emergency Medicine. Fellows use the designation FAAEM. 

The American College of Veterinary Emergency र Critical Care (ACVECC) is the governing body that offers board-certification to veterinarians who have completed an accredited residency program र passed a rigorous written, practical र oral certification examination. Specialists are known as criticalists, र most are employed in referral practice or academic institutions. It is a rapidly expanding field of veterinary medicine. Specialists are given the desgination of DACVECC after becoming certified for Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency र Critical Care.

The American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) provides board certification to allopathic (M.D.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional year of practice, passed a written exam, र then an oral exam. 

The American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine (AOBEM) provides board certification to osteopathic (D.O.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional two years of practice, passed a written exam, र passed an oral exam. 

The American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) also offers Board Certification in Emergency Medicine (BCEM). This certification is offered to experienced physicians who have completed residency training in related primary care fields, who have more than 5 years of full-time emergency medicine experience, are certified in ACLS/PALS/ATLS courses, provide letters of recommendation, र file 10 case reports - all required prior to passing both written र oral tests. The ABPS certification is more widely recognized in rural र suburban hospitals. The 'grandfathering-in' of other experienced non-residency trained physicians practicing emergency medicine was closed off from ABEM र AOBEM several years ago, likewise from BCEM if the doctor has not completed a residency. Currently (as of 7/06), only the state of Florida has recognized BCEM at the state medical board level, but many hospitals across the country do recognize BCEM. 

Board certification is maintained through annual testing over required reading lists र a more extensive written exam every 10 years (for ABEM), every 8 years for BCEM. 

Many types of physicians may practice in an Emerency Department; however, only those who have successfully passed the board certification process are considered "Emergency Medicine Specialists". Currently the ABEM र AOBEM require a number of years of residency training after medical school, followed by comprehensive written र oral examinations. The BCEM requires (in addition to passing written र oral examinations) completion of an ACGME approved residency in an approved specialty such as Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, 5 years of the practice of emergency medicine, 10 Peer reviewed case reports, current ATLS/PALS/ACLS certification र 3 letters of recommendation from peers. 

A sudden surge of interest in the specialty in the late 1990s was due to the popularity of the American TV series ER.

In the United Kingdom र Ireland, the College of Emergency Medicine sets the examinations that trainees in Emergency Medicine take in order to become consultants (fully-trained emergency physicians). The British Association for Emergency Medicine is the member organization in the UK. In 2005, the two organisations initiated steps to merge as the College of Emergency Medicine.

In Australia र New Zealand, advanced training in Emergency Medicine is overseen by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM).

In Canada, there are two routes to practice emergency medicine. More than two thirds of physicians currently practicing emergency medicine across the nation have no specific emergency medicine residency training. Emergency physicians who tend to work in more community-based settings complete a residency specializing in Family Medicine र then proceed to obtain an additional year of training of special competence on Emergency Medicine from the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CCFP-EM). Physicians practicing in major urban/tertiary care hospitals will often pursue a 5 year specialist residency in Emergency Medicine, certified by the Royal College of Physicians र Surgeons of Canada. These members typically spend a great deal of time in academic र leadership roles within emergency medicine, EMS, research, र other avenues. There is no significant difference in remuneration or clinical practice type between physicians certified by either route.

In the US, Emergency Medicine is one of the more competitive specialties to get into, र residency programs generally select physicians from the top of their medical school class. There are usually many physicians competing for each residency spot.

Allopathic (M.D.) emergency medicine residencies can be 3 or 4 years in length, combining both the internship र residency into one program or "1+3," utilizing a separate internship followed by 3 years of Emergency Medicine. Osteopathic (D.O.) residencies are four years in length, requiring a one year traditional rotating internship followed by a three-year emergency medicine residency. In addition to the didactic exposure, much of an emergency medicine residency involves rotating through other specialties with a majority of such rotations through the emergency department itself. By the end of their training, EPs are expected to handle a vast field of medical, surgical, र psychiatric emergencies. EPs are therefore both clinical generalists र well-rounded diagnosticians. EPs are considered specialists in advance cardiac life support protocols ('codes') र airway management.

The employment arrangement of emergency physician practices are either private (a democratic group of EPs staff an ED under contract), institutional (EPs with an independent contractor relationship with the hospital), or corporate (EPs with an independent contractor relationship with a third party staffing company that services multiple emergency departments). 

Most emergency physicians staff hospital emergency departments in shifts, a job structure necessitated by the 24/7 nature of the emergency department.

Emergency medicine focuses on diagnosis र treatment of acute illnesses र injuries that require immediate care. While not usually providing long-term care, EM physicians र pre-hospital personnel still provide care with the aim of improving long-term patient outcome. In the United States, some people use the emergency department for outpatient care that could be provided at a doctor's office. As a result, much of emergency room care is general practice (coughs, colds, aches, pains). 

A variant of an Emergency Department is an Urgent Care Center, often staffed by non-Emergency Medicine trained physicians and/or nurses, which treats patients who desire or require immediate care, but do not reach the acuity that requires care in an emergency department. 

Emergency Medicine involves a large amount of general medicine but involves all fields of medicine including the surgical sub-specialties. Emergency Physicians are tasked with seeing a large number of patients, treating their illnesses र admitting them to the hospital as necessary. The field requires a broad field of knowledge र requires advance procedural skills often including surgical procedures, trauma resuscitation, advance cardiac life support र advanced airway management.

"Emergency medicine is a field of practice based on the knowledge र skills required for the prevention, diagnosis र management of acute र urgent aspects of illness र injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical र behavioural disorders.

Emergency Medicine as a standalone medical specialty is relatively young. Prior to the 1960's र 70's, hospital emergency rooms were generally staffed by doctors trained in other specialties, such as internal medicine र primary care. However, during this time period, groups of physicians mostly located in the midwestern United States (notably Cincinnati, Ohio, र Denver, Colorado) recognized the need, र the niche, for physicians specifically trained to handle acute medical emergencies.
In the United States, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) is presently the largest member organization of emergency physicians (EPs), र is open to most physicians who practice in an Emergency Department. Originally founded in 1968, it was the first Emergency Medicine society formed in the United States. Fellows use the designation FACEP. 

The American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians (ACOEP) was founded seven years later in 1975. Membership is open to both osteopathic (D.O.) र allopathic (M.D.) physicians who practice emergency medicine. Fellows use the designation FACOEP.

The American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) is another specialty society of Emergency Medicine. It was formed after ACEP र ACOEP र is considered a rival organization although both organizations have cooperated in the past. Members must be board certified in Emergency Medicine. Fellows use the designation FAAEM. 

The American College of Veterinary Emergency र Critical Care (ACVECC) is the governing body that offers board-certification to veterinarians who have completed an accredited residency program र passed a rigorous written, practical र oral certification examination. Specialists are known as criticalists, र most are employed in referral practice or academic institutions. It is a rapidly expanding field of veterinary medicine. Specialists are given the desgination of DACVECC after becoming certified for Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency र Critical Care.

The American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) provides board certification to allopathic (M.D.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional year of practice, passed a written exam, र then an oral exam. 

The American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine (AOBEM) provides board certification to osteopathic (D.O.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional two years of practice, passed a written exam, र passed an oral exam. 

The American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) also offers Board Certification in Emergency Medicine (BCEM). This certification is offered to experienced physicians who have completed residency training in related primary care fields, who have more than 5 years of full-time emergency medicine experience, are certified in ACLS/PALS/ATLS courses, provide letters of recommendation, र file 10 case reports - all required prior to passing both written र oral tests. The ABPS certification is more widely recognized in rural र suburban hospitals. The 'grandfathering-in' of other experienced non-residency trained physicians practicing emergency medicine was closed off from ABEM र AOBEM several years ago, likewise from BCEM if the doctor has not completed a residency. Currently (as of 7/06), only the state of Florida has recognized BCEM at the state medical board level, but many hospitals across the country do recognize BCEM. 

Board certification is maintained through annual testing over required reading lists र a more extensive written exam every 10 years (for ABEM), every 8 years for BCEM. 

Many types of physicians may practice in an Emerency Department; however, only those who have successfully passed the board certification process are considered "Emergency Medicine Specialists". Currently the ABEM र AOBEM require a number of years of residency training after medical school, followed by comprehensive written र oral examinations.

The BCEM requires (in addition to passing written र oral examinations) completion of an ACGME approved residency in an approved specialty such as Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, 5 years of the practice of emergency medicine, 10 Peer reviewed case reports, current ATLS/PALS/ACLS certification र 3 letters of recommendation from peers. 

A sudden surge of interest in the specialty in the late 1990s was due to the popularity of the American TV series ER. Showcasing the function of a Chicago Emergency Department (loosely based on Cook County Hospital) र its many characters, the show introduced a large number of people to the specialty. 

In the United Kingdom र Ireland, the College of Emergency Medicine sets the examinations that trainees in Emergency Medicine take in order to become consultants (fully-trained emergency physicians). The British Association for Emergency Medicine is the member organization in the UK. In 2005, the two organisations initiated steps to merge as the College of Emergency Medicine.

In Australia र New Zealand, advanced training in Emergency Medicine is overseen by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM).

In Canada, there are two routes to practice emergency medicine. More than two thirds of physicians currently practicing emergency medicine across the nation have no specific emergency medicine residency training. Emergency physicians who tend to work in more community-based settings complete a residency specializing in Family Medicine र then proceed to obtain an additional year of training of special competence on Emergency Medicine from the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CCFP-EM). Physicians practicing in major urban/tertiary care hospitals will often pursue a 5 year specialist residency in Emergency Medicine, certified by the Royal College of Physicians र Surgeons of Canada. These members typically spend a great deal of time in academic र leadership roles within emergency medicine, EMS, research, र other avenues. There is no significant difference in remuneration or clinical practice type between physicians certified by either route.

In the US, Emergency Medicine is one of the more competitive specialties to get into, र residency programs generally select physicians from the top of their medical school class. There are usually many physicians competing for each residency spot.

Allopathic (M.D.) emergency medicine residencies can be 3 or 4 years in length, combining both the internship र residency into one program or "1+3," utilizing a separate internship followed by 3 years of Emergency Medicine. Osteopathic (D.O.) residencies are four years in length, requiring a one year traditional rotating internship followed by a three-year emergency medicine residency. In addition to the didactic exposure, much of an emergency medicine residency involves rotating through other specialties with a majority of such rotations through the emergency department itself. By the end of their training, EPs are expected to handle a vast field of medical, surgical, र psychiatric emergencies. EPs are therefore both clinical generalists र well-rounded diagnosticians. EPs are considered specialists in advance cardiac life support protocols ('codes') र airway management.

The employment arrangement of emergency physician practices are either private (a democratic group of EPs staff an ED under contract), institutional (EPs with an independent contractor relationship with the hospital), or corporate (EPs with an independent contractor relationship with a third party staffing company that services multiple emergency departments). 

Most emergency physicians staff hospital emergency departments in shifts, a job structure necessitated by the 24/7 nature of the emergency department.

Emergency medicine focuses on diagnosis र treatment of acute illnesses र injuries that require immediate care. While not usually providing long-term care, EM physicians र pre-hospital personnel still provide care with the aim of improving long-term patient outcome. In the United States, some people use the emergency department for outpatient care that could be provided at a doctor's office. As a result, much of emergency room care is general practice (coughs, colds, aches, pains). 

A variant of an Emergency Department is an Urgent Care Center, often staffed by non-Emergency Medicine trained physicians and/or nurses, which treats patients who desire or require immediate care, but do not reach the acuity that requires care in an emergency department. 

Emergency Medicine involves a large amount of general medicine but involves all fields of medicine including the surgical sub-specialties. Emergency Physicians are tasked with seeing a large number of patients, treating their illnesses र admitting them to the hospital as necessary. The field requires a broad field of knowledge र requires advance procedural skills often including surgical procedures, trauma resuscitation, advance cardiac life support र advanced airway management.

"Emergency medicine is a field of practice based on the knowledge र skills required for the prevention, diagnosis र management of acute र urgent aspects of illness र injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical र behavioural disorders. It further encompasses an understanding of the development of pre-hospital र in-hospital emergency medical systems र the skills necessary for this development."

Emergency Medicine as a standalone medical specialty is relatively young. Prior to the १९६०'s र ७०'s, hospital emergency rooms were generally staffed by doctors trained in other specialties, such as internal medicine र primary care. However, during this time period, groups of physicians mostly located in the midwestern United States (notably Cincinnati, Ohio, र Denver, Colorado) recognized the need, र the niche, for physicians specifically trained to handle acute medical emergencies.
In the United States, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) is presently the largest member organization of emergency physicians (EPs), र is open to most physicians who practice in an Emergency Department. Originally founded in १९६८, it was the first Emergency Medicine society formed in the United States. Fellows use the designation FACEP. 

The American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians (ACOEP) was founded seven years later in १९७५. Membership is open to both osteopathic (D.O.) र allopathic (M.D.) physicians who practice emergency medicine. Fellows use the designation FACOEP.

The American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) is another specialty society of Emergency Medicine. It was formed after ACEP र ACOEP र is considered a rival organization although both organizations have cooperated in the past. Members must be board certified in Emergency Medicine. Fellows use the designation FAAEM. 

The American College of Veterinary Emergency र Critical Care (ACVECC) is the governing body that offers board-certification to veterinarians who have completed an accredited residency program र passed a rigorous written, practical र oral certification examination. Specialists are known as criticalists, र most are employed in referral practice or academic institutions. It is a rapidly expanding field of veterinary medicine. Specialists are given the desgination of DACVECC after becoming certified for Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency र Critical Care.

The American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) provides board certification to allopathic (M.D.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional year of practice, passed a written exam, र then an oral exam. 

The American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine (AOBEM) provides board certification to osteopathic (D.O.) emergency physicians who have successfully completed a residency in emergency medicine, completed an additional two years of practice, passed a written exam, र passed an oral exam. 

The American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) also offers Board Certification in Emergency Medicine (BCEM). This certification is offered to experienced physicians who have completed residency training in related primary care fields, who have more than ५ years of full-time emergency medicine experience, are certified in ACLS/PALS/ATLS courses, provide letters of recommendation, र file १० case reports - all required prior to passing both written र oral tests. The ABPS certification is more widely recognized in rural र suburban hospitals. The 'grandfathering-in' of other experienced non-residency trained physicians practicing emergency medicine was closed off from ABEM र AOBEM several years ago, likewise from BCEM if the doctor has not completed a residency. Currently (as of ७/०६), only the state of Florida has recognized BCEM at the state medical board level, but many hospitals across the country do recognize BCEM. 

Board certification is maintained through annual testing over required reading lists र a more extensive written exam every १० years (for ABEM), every ८ years for BCEM.
