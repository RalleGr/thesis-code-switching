Orthopedic surgery or orthopedics (also spelled orthopaedics, see below) is the branch of surgery concerned with acute, chronic, traumatic, and overuse injuries and other disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma and congenital deformities using both surgical and non-surgical means. 

Orthopedic surgeons are physicians who have completed additional training in orthopedic surgery after the completion of medical school. According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (2006-2007) published by the U.S. Department of Labor, between 3-4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons.

In the United States and Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of 13 years of postsecondary education and clinical training. This training includes obtaining an undergraduate degree, a medical degree, and then completing a 5-year residency in orthopedic surgery. The 5-year residency consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last 1-2 years and usually have a research component involved with the clinical and operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship and obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma and congenital deformities using both surgical and non-surgical means. According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between 1999 to 2003 these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves 50-55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties and possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of his hospital and for his published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] and [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] and [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] and led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fracture]]s in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, and malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment and lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common and serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, and [[dance|dancers]] invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong and complex mechanics of the knee joint and restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery and musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive and to make implanted components better and more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery and re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today and is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty--both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design and technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients and later by Gunston and Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall and Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation and has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist and ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures and injuries occur in children due to their high activity level and unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate|growth plates]] in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, and at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity and may progress to cause chronic pain and breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated and often involves a combination of bracing and surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] and [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones and joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities and diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") and "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting and Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university and residency programs, and even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance|dancers]] invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty--both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate|growth plates]] in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

Orthopedic surgery or orthopedics (also spelled orthopaedics, see below) is the branch of [[surgery]] concerned with [[Acute (medical)|acute]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]]tic, र overuse [[injury|injuries]] र other disorders of the [[musculoskeletal system]]. Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. 

Orthopedic surgeons are [[physicians]] who have completed additional training in orthopedic surgery after the completion of medical school. According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (2006-2007) published by the U.S. Department of Labor, between 3-4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons.

In the United States र Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of 13 years of [[postsecondary education]] र clinical training. This training includes obtaining an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate degree]], a medical degree, र then completing a 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopedic surgery. The 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last 1-2 years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship र obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between 1999 to 2003 these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves 50-55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate|growth plates]] in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

हाडजोर्नी शल्यचिकित्सा वा अर्थोपेडिक्स [[शल्यचिकित्सा]]को एक क्षेत्र हो। यो क्षेत्र [[एक्युट (चिकित्सा)|एक्युट]], [[क्रोनिक (चिकित्सा)|क्रोनिक]], [[शारीरिक ट्रमा|ट्रमा]] र ओभरयुज overuse [[injury|injuries]] र अन्य [[मस्कुलोस्केलिटल व्यवस्था]]का रोगहरुसँग सम्बन्धित छ। Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. 

Orthopedic surgeons are [[physicians]] who have completed additional training in orthopedic surgery after the completion of medical school. According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (2006-2007) published by the U.S. Department of Labor, between 3-4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons.

In the United States र Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of 13 years of [[postsecondary education]] र clinical training. This training includes obtaining an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate degree]], a medical degree, र then completing a 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopedic surgery. The 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last 1-2 years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship र obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between 1999 to 2003 these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves 50-55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of उनका hospital र for उनका published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fracture]]s in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance|dancers]] invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty--both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

हाडजोर्नी शल्यचिकित्सा वा अर्थोपेडिक्स [[शल्यचिकित्सा]]को एक क्षेत्र हो। यो क्षेत्र [[एक्युट (चिकित्सा)|एक्युट]], [[क्रोनिक (चिकित्सा)|क्रोनिक]], [[शारीरिक ट्रमा|ट्रमा]] र ओभरयुज overuse [[injury|injuries]] र अन्य [[मस्कुलोस्केलिटल व्यवस्था]]का रोगहरुसँग सम्बन्धित छ। Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. 

Orthopedic surgeons are [[physicians]] who have completed additional training in orthopedic surgery after the completion of medical school. According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (2006-2007) published by the U.S. Department of Labor, between 3-4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons.

In the United States र Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of 13 years of [[postsecondary education]] र clinical training. This training includes obtaining an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate degree]], a medical degree, र then completing a 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopedic surgery. The 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last 1-2 years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship र obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between 1999 to 2003 these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves 50-55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of उनका hospital र for उनका published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fracture]]s in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance|dancers]] invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty--both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate|growth plates]] in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

हाडजोर्नी शल्यचिकित्सा वा अर्थोपेडिक्स [[शल्यचिकित्सा]]को एक क्षेत्र हो। यो क्षेत्र [[एक्युट (चिकित्सा)|एक्युट]], [[क्रोनिक (चिकित्सा)|क्रोनिक]], [[शारीरिक ट्रमा|ट्रमा]] र ओभरयुज overuse [[injury|injuries]] र अन्य [[मस्कुलोस्केलिटल व्यवस्था]]का रोगहरुसँग सम्बन्धित छ। Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. 

Orthopedic surgeons are [[physicians]] who have completed additional training in orthopedic surgery after the completion of medical school. According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (2006-2007) published by the U.S. Department of Labor, between 3-4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons.

In the United States र Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of 13 years of [[postsecondary education]] र clinical training. This training includes obtaining an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate degree]], a medical degree, र then completing a 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopedic surgery. The 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last 1-2 years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship र obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between 1999 to 2003 these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves 50-55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of उनका hospital र for उनका published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fracture]]s in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance|dancers]] invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty--both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate|growth plates]] in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

In the United States र Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of 13 years of [[postsecondary education]] र clinical training. This training includes obtaining an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate degree]], a medical degree, र then completing a 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopedic surgery. The 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last 1–2 years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship र obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between 1999 to 2003 these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves 50–55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of उनका hospital र for उनका published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fractures]] in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance]]rs invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty—both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate]]s in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

These fellowships typically last 1–2 years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship र obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between 1999 to 2003 these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves 50–55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of उनका hospital र for उनका published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fractures]] in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance]]rs invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty—both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate]]s in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between 1999 to 2003 these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves 50–55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of उनका hospital र for उनका published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fractures]] in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance]]rs invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty—both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate]]s in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

In the United States र Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of 13 years of [[postsecondary education]] र clinical training. This training includes obtaining an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate degree]], a medical degree, र then completing a 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopedic surgery. The 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training.

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves 50–55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of उनका hospital र for उनका published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fractures]] in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance]]rs invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty—both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate]]s in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

Orthopedic surgeons are [[physicians]] who have completed additional training in orthopedic surgery after the completion of medical school. According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (2006-2007) published by the U.S. Department of Labor, between 3-4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons.

In the United States र Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of 13 years of [[postsecondary education]] र clinical training. This training includes obtaining an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate degree]], a medical degree, र then completing a 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopedic surgery. The 5-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last 1–2 years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship र obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty—both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970's. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate]]s in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of 81 he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

Orthopedic surgeons are [[physicians]] who have completed additional training in orthopedic surgery after the completion of medical school. According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (२००६-२००७) published by the U.S. Department of Labor, between ३-४% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons.

In the United States र Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of १३ years of [[postsecondary education]] र clinical training. This training includes obtaining an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate degree]], a medical degree, र then completing a ५-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopedic surgery. The ५-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last १–२ years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship र obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. According to applications for board certification from १९९९ to २००३, the top २५ most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between १९९९ to २००३ these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves ५०–५५ hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of उनका hospital र for उनका published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fractures]] in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance]]rs invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments.

The ५-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last १–२ years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:


These are also the nine main sub-specialty areas of orthopaedic surgery.

Hand surgery is the only truly recognized sub-specialty within orthopaedic surgery. The other sub-specialities are informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a hand surgeon, a practitioner must have completed a fellowship र obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.

Orthopaedic surgeons address most musculoskeletal ailments including arthritis, trauma र congenital deformities using both surgical र non-surgical means. According to applications for board certification from १९९९ to २००३, the top २५ most common procedures (in order) gdhkchd performed by orthopaedic surgeons are as follows:

Of orthopaedic surgeons applying for certification with the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery between १९९९ to २००३ these were the percentages of surgeons in each specialty area:

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopaedic surgeon involves ५०–५५ hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties र possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting.

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in [[1780]], which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopedist in consideraton of the establishment of उनका hospital र for उनका published methods.

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in [[1851]].

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fractures]] in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance]]rs invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Watanabe of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty—both of which are removal of a torn cartilage. 

The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir John Charnley in England in the १९६०s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] cement. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the १९७०'s. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate]]s in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of ८१ he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design र technique of joint replacement ([[arthroplasty]]) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. 

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients र later by Gunston र Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the १९७०'s. The modern [[knee replacement]] was developed by Dr. John Insall र Dr. Chitranjan Ranawat in New York. Uni-compartment knee replacement, in which only one side of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a smaller operation र has become popular recently. 

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist र ankle.

The treatment of children with muscoloskeletal problems remains an integral part of modern orthopaedic surgery. Many fractures र injuries occur in children due to their high activity level र unique immature skeleton. Treatment of fractures in children is different than adults due to active [[growth plate]]s in their bones. Damage to the growth plate can lead to significant problems with later bone growth, र at-risk fractures have to be monitored with care. 

The treatment of [[scoliosis]] is a mainstay of pediatric orthopaedics. For poorly understood reasons, curvature devlops in the spine of some children, which if left untreated leads to undesireable deformity र may progress to cause chronic pain र breathing problems. The treatment of scoliosis is quite complicated र often involves a combination of bracing र surgery.

Children have other unique musculoskeletal conditions that have been a focus of orthopedics since Hippocrates, including conditions such as [[club foot]] र [[congenital]] [[dislocation of hip]] (also known as [[hip dysplasia|developmental dysplasia of the hip]]). In addition, [[infections]] in bones र joints ([[osteomyelitis]]) in children are common. In the US, specialized hospitals such as the [[Shriners]] hospitals have provided a substantial portion of treatment for children with musculoskeletal deformities र diseases.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "orthopaedics", derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[word]]s for "correct" or "straight" ("orthos") र "[[child]]" ("paidion"), in [[1741]], when at the [[Ageing|age]] of ८१ he [[Publishing|published]] "Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting र Preventing Deformities in Children". 

In the U.S. the spelling "orthopedics" is standard, although the majority of university र residency programs, र even the AAOS, still use Andry's spelling. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are common; "orthopaedics" usually prevails in the rest of the Commonwealth, especially in Britain; see also [[spelling differences]].

In the United States र Canada orthopedic surgeons (also know as orthopedists) complete a minimum of १३ years of [[postsecondary education]] र clinical training. This training includes obtaining an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate degree]], a medical degree, र then completing a ५-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopedic surgery. The ५-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopaedic surgery.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further subspeciality training in programs known as 'fellowships' after completing their residency training. These fellowships typically last १–२ years र usually have a [[research]] component involved with the clinical र operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspeciality training in the US are:

Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] र [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] र [[tibia]] was pioneered by Dr. Kunchner of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] र led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fractures]] in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late [[1970s]] when the [[Seattle Harborview]] group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the [[1950s]]. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, र malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment र lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today.

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]]. This common र serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, र [[dance]]rs invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr. MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong र complex mechanics of the knee joint र restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels. 

Modern orthopaedic surgery र musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive र to make implanted components better र more durable.

The use of [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic tools]] has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered by Dr. Bijay of Japan to perform [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive cartilage surgery र re-constructions]] lol ligaments. Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the goop in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today र is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty—both of which are removal of a torn cartilage.

Plastic surgery is a general term for operative manual and instrumental treatment which is performed for functional or aesthetic reasons. The word "plastic" derives from the Greek "plastikos" meaning to mold or to shape; its use here is not connected with modern plastics.

The principal areas of plastic surgery include two broad fields.

The history of cosmetic surgery reaches back to the ancient world. Physicians in ancient India including the great Indian surgeon Susrutha were utilizing skin grafts for reconstructive work as early as the 8th century BC. His work "Sushruta Samhita" describes rhinoplasty and otoplasty. This knowledge of plastic surgery existed in India up to the late 18th century as can be seen from the reports published in "Gentleman's Magazine" (October 1794). 

The Romans were able to perform simple techniques such as repairing damaged ears from around the 1st century BC. In mid-15th century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process "to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, and the dogs have devoured it" by removing skin from the back of the arm and suturing it in place. However, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that such surgeries became commonplace. 

The U.S.'s first plastic surgeon was Dr. John Peter Mettauer. He performed the first cleft palate operation in 1827 with instruments that he designed himself. The New Zealander Sir Harold Gillies developed many of the techniques of modern plastic surgery in caring for those who suffered facial injuries in World War I, he is considered to be the father of modern plastic surgery. His work was expanded upon during World War II by one of his former students and cousin, Archibald McIndoe, who pioneered treatments for RAF aircrew suffering from severe burns. McIndoe's radical, experimental treatments, lead to the formation of the Guinea Pig Club.

Common reconstructive surgeries are: breast reconstruction for women who have had a mastectomy, cleft lip and palate surgery, contracture surgery for burn survivors, and closing skin and mucosa defects after removal of tumors in the head and neck region. Sex reassignment surgery for transsexual people is another example of reconstructive surgery. 

Plastic surgeons have developed the use of microsurgery to transfer tissue for coverage of a defect when no local tissue is available. Tissue "flaps" comprised of skin, muscle, bone, fat or a combination, may be removed from the body, moved to another site on the body and reconnected to a blood supply by suturing arteries and veins as small as 1-2 mm in diameter.

There is a definite gray area between reconstructive and cosmetic surgery. Many of the techniques of cosmetic surgery are utilized in reconstructive surgery to improve cosmesis.

Cosmetic surgery is a very popular avenue for personal enhancement, as demonstrated by the 11.9 million cosmetic procedures performed in the U.S. alone in 2004. As for any operation, cosmetic procedures involve risk, and should therefore not be undertaken lightly. Within the US, critics of plastic surgery note that it is legal for any doctor, regardless of speciality, to perform "cosmetic surgery", but not "plastic surgery". It is thus important to distinguish the terms "plastic surgery" and "cosmetic surgery": Plastic Surgery is recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (the only official entity overseeing physician certification in the United States) as the subspecialty dedicated to the surgical repair of defects of form or function -- this includes cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery, as well as reconstructive surgery. The term "cosmetic surgery" however, simply refers to surgery that is designed to improve cosmetics, or appearance. (One could argue that reconstructive surgery always has some cosmetic aspect to it, because form and function are often both important in plastic surgery repairs.) Thus there is no real art of "cosmetic surgery": it is a catch-all commercial phrase that laypeople understand easily and non-plastic surgeons eagerly use because they are not allowed to use the term "plastic surgery".

The most prevalent aesthetic/cosmetic procedures are listed below. Most of these types of surgery are more commonly known by their "common names." These are also listed when pertinent.

Plastic surgery is a broad field, and may be subdivided further. Plastic surgery training and approval by the American Board of Plastic Surgery includes mastery of the following as well:




Some people appear to become addicted to cosmetic surgery, possibly because of body dysmorphic disorder. Sufficient amounts of repeated cosmetic surgery can lead to irreversible damage to the normal body structure. However, due to the high cost of repeated cosmetic surgery, this disorder is generally one limited to the wealthy. However, others have been known to take out loans for repeat procedures.




Surgical oncology is the branch of surgery which focuses on the surgical management of malignant neoplasms (cancer).

Whether surgical oncology constitutes a medical specialty "per se" is the topic of a heated debate. Today, some would agree that it is simply impossible for any one surgeon to be competent in the surgical management of "all" malignant disease. However, there are currently 14 surgical oncology fellowship training programs in the United States that have been approved by the Society of Surgical Oncology. While many general surgeons are actively involved in treating patients with malignant neoplasms, the designation of "surgical oncologist" is generally reserved for those surgeons who have completed one of the approved fellowship programs. However, this is a matter of semantics, as many surgeons who are thoroughly involved in treating cancer patients may consider themselves to be surgical oncologists.

Most often, "surgical oncologist" refers to a general surgical oncologist (cf. General Surgery), but thoracic surgical oncologists, gynecologic oncologists and so forth can all be considered surgeons who specialize in treating cancer patients.

The importance of training surgeons who sub-specialize in cancer surgery lies in evidence, supported by a number of clinical trials, that outcomes in surgical cancer care are positively associated to surgeon volume -- i.e. the more cancer cases a surgeon treats, the more proficient he becomes, and his or her patients experience improved survival rates as a result. This is another controversial point, but it is generally accepted -- even as common sense -- that a surgeon who performs a given operation more often, will achieve superior results when compared with a surgeon who rarely performs the same procedure. This is particularly true of cancer resections such as pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) for pancreatic cancer, and gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer.

Plastic surgery is a general term for operative manual and instrumental treatment which is performed for functional or aesthetic reasons. The word "plastic" derives from the Greek "plastikos" meaning to mold or to shape; its use here is not connected with modern plastics.

The principal areas of plastic surgery include two broad fields.

The history of cosmetic surgery reaches back to the ancient world. Physicians in ancient India including the great Indian surgeon Susrutha were utilizing skin grafts for reconstructive work as early as the 8th century BC. His work "Sushruta Samhita" describes rhinoplasty and otoplasty. This knowledge of plastic surgery existed in India up to the late 18th century as can be seen from the reports published in "Gentleman's Magazine" (October 1794). 

The Romans were able to perform simple techniques such as repairing damaged ears from around the 1st century BC. In mid-15th century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process "to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, and the dogs have devoured it" by removing skin from the back of the arm and suturing it in place. However, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that such surgeries became commonplace. 

The U.S.'s first plastic surgeon was Dr. John Peter Mettauer. He performed the first cleft palate operation in 1827 with instruments that he designed himself. The New Zealander Sir Harold Gillies developed many of the techniques of modern plastic surgery in caring for those who suffered facial injuries in World War I, he is considered to be the father of modern plastic surgery. His work was expanded upon during World War II by one of his former students and cousin, Archibald McIndoe, who pioneered treatments for RAF aircrew suffering from severe burns. McIndoe's radical, experimental treatments, lead to the formation of the Guinea Pig Club.

Common reconstructive surgeries are: breast reconstruction for women who have had a mastectomy, cleft lip and palate surgery, contracture surgery for burn survivors, and closing skin and mucosa defects after removal of tumors in the head and neck region. Sex reassignment surgery for transsexual people is another example of reconstructive surgery. 

Plastic surgeons have developed the use of microsurgery to transfer tissue for coverage of a defect when no local tissue is available. Tissue "flaps" comprised of skin, muscle, bone, fat or a combination, may be removed from the body, moved to another site on the body and reconnected to a blood supply by suturing arteries and veins as small as 1-2 mm in diameter.

There is a definite gray area between reconstructive and cosmetic surgery. Many of the techniques of cosmetic surgery are utilized in reconstructive surgery to improve cosmesis.

The history of cosmetic surgery reaches back to the ancient world. Physicians in ancient India including the great Indian surgeon Susrutha were utilizing skin grafts for reconstructive work as early as the 8th century BC.

This knowledge of plastic surgery existed in India up to the late 18th century as can be seen from the reports published in "Gentleman's Magazine" (October 1794). 

The Romans were able to perform simple techniques such as repairing damaged ears from around the 1st century BC. In mid-15th century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process "to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, र the dogs have devoured it" by removing skin from the back of the arm र suturing it in place. However, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not until the 19th र 20th centuries that such surgeries became commonplace. 

The U.S.'s first plastic surgeon was Dr. John Peter Mettauer. He performed the first cleft palate operation in 1827 with instruments that he designed himself. The New Zealander Sir Harold Gillies developed many of the techniques of modern plastic surgery in caring for those who suffered facial injuries in World War I, he is considered to be the father of modern plastic surgery.

However, due to the high cost of repeated cosmetic surgery, this disorder is generally one limited to the wealthy. However, others have been known to take out loans for repeat procedures.




Plastic surgery is a general term for operative manual र instrumental treatment which is performed for functional or aesthetic reasons. The word "plastic" derives from the Greek "plastikos" meaning to mold or to shape; its use here is not connected with modern plastics.

The principal areas of plastic surgery include two broad fields.

The history of cosmetic surgery reaches back to the ancient world. Physicians in ancient India including the great Indian surgeon Susrutha were utilizing skin grafts for reconstructive work as early as the 8th century BC. His work "Sushruta Samhita" describes rhinoplasty र otoplasty. This knowledge of plastic surgery existed in India up to the late 18th century as can be seen from the reports published in "Gentleman's Magazine" (October 1794). 

The Romans were able to perform simple techniques such as repairing damaged ears from around the 1st century BC. In mid-15th century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process "to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, र the dogs have devoured it" by removing skin from the back of the arm र suturing it in place. However, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not until the 19th र 20th centuries that such surgeries became commonplace. 

The U.S.'s first plastic surgeon was Dr. John Peter Mettauer. He performed the first cleft palate operation in 1827 with instruments that he designed himself. The New Zealander Sir Harold Gillies developed many of the techniques of modern plastic surgery in caring for those who suffered facial injuries in World War I, he is considered to be the father of modern plastic surgery. His work was expanded upon during World War II by one of उनका former students र cousin, Archibald McIndoe, who pioneered treatments for RAF aircrew suffering from severe burns. McIndoe's radical, experimental treatments, lead to the formation of the Guinea Pig Club.

Common reconstructive surgeries are: breast reconstruction for women who have had a mastectomy, cleft lip र palate surgery, contracture surgery for burn survivors, र closing skin र mucosa defects after removal of tumors in the head र neck region. Sex reassignment surgery for transsexual people is another example of reconstructive surgery. 

Plastic surgeons have developed the use of microsurgery to transfer tissue for coverage of a defect when no local tissue is available. Tissue "flaps" comprised of skin, muscle, bone, fat or a combination, may be removed from the body, moved to another site on the body र reconnected to a blood supply by suturing arteries र veins as small as 1-2 mm in diameter.

There is a definite gray area between reconstructive र cosmetic surgery. Many of the techniques of cosmetic surgery are utilized in reconstructive surgery to improve cosmesis.

Cosmetic surgery is a very popular avenue for personal enhancement, as demonstrated by the 11.9 million cosmetic procedures performed in the U.S. alone in 2004. As for any operation, cosmetic procedures involve risk, र should therefore not be undertaken lightly. Within the US, critics of plastic surgery note that it is legal for any doctor, regardless of speciality, to perform "cosmetic surgery", but not "plastic surgery". It is thus important to distinguish the terms "plastic surgery" र "cosmetic surgery": Plastic Surgery is recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (the only official entity overseeing physician certification in the United States) as the subspecialty dedicated to the surgical repair of defects of form or function -- this includes cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery, as well as reconstructive surgery. The term "cosmetic surgery" however, simply refers to surgery that is designed to improve cosmetics, or appearance. (One could argue that reconstructive surgery always has some cosmetic aspect to it, because form र function are often both important in plastic surgery repairs.) Thus there is no real art of "cosmetic surgery": it is a catch-all commercial phrase that laypeople understand easily र non-plastic surgeons eagerly use because they are not allowed to use the term "plastic surgery".

The most prevalent aesthetic/cosmetic procedures are listed below. Most of these types of surgery are more commonly known by their "common names." These are also listed when pertinent.

The history of cosmetic surgery reaches back to the ancient world. Physicians in ancient India including the great Indian surgeon Susrutha were utilizing skin grafts for reconstructive work as early as the 8th century BC. His work "Sushruta Samhita" describes rhinoplasty र otoplasty. This knowledge of plastic surgery existed in India up to the late 18th century as can be seen from the reports published in "Gentleman's Magazine" (October 1794). 

The Romans were able to perform simple techniques such as repairing damaged ears from around the 1st century BC. In mid-15th century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process "to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, र the dogs have devoured it" by removing skin from the back of the arm र suturing it in place. However, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not until the 19th र 20th centuries that such surgeries became commonplace. 

The U.S.'s first plastic surgeon was Dr. John Peter Mettauer. He performed the first cleft palate operation in 1827 with instruments that he designed himself. The New Zealander Sir Harold Gillies developed many of the techniques of modern plastic surgery in caring for those who suffered facial injuries in World War I, he is considered to be the father of modern plastic surgery. His work was expanded upon during World War II by one of उनका former students र cousin, Archibald McIndoe, who pioneered treatments for RAF aircrew suffering from severe burns. McIndoe's radical, experimental treatments, lead to the formation of the Guinea Pig Club.

Common reconstructive surgeries are: breast reconstruction for women who have had a mastectomy, cleft lip र palate surgery, contracture surgery for burn survivors, र closing skin र mucosa defects after removal of tumors in the head र neck region. Sex reassignment surgery for transsexual people is another example of reconstructive surgery. 

Plastic surgeons have developed the use of microsurgery to transfer tissue for coverage of a defect when no local tissue is available. Tissue "flaps" comprised of skin, muscle, bone, fat or a combination, may be removed from the body, moved to another site on the body र reconnected to a blood supply by suturing arteries र veins as small as 1–2 mm in diameter.

There is a definite gray area between reconstructive र cosmetic surgery. Many of the techniques of cosmetic surgery are utilized in reconstructive surgery to improve cosmesis.

Cosmetic surgery is a very popular avenue for personal enhancement, as demonstrated by the 11.9 million cosmetic procedures performed in the U.S. alone in 2004.

The New Zealander Sir Harold Gillies developed many of the techniques of modern plastic surgery in caring for those who suffered facial injuries in World War I, he is considered to be the father of modern plastic surgery. His work was expanded upon during World War II by one of उनका former students र cousin, Archibald McIndoe, who pioneered treatments for RAF aircrew suffering from severe burns. McIndoe's radical, experimental treatments, lead to the formation of the Guinea Pig Club.

Common reconstructive surgeries are: breast reconstruction for women who have had a mastectomy, cleft lip र palate surgery, contracture surgery for burn survivors, र closing skin र mucosa defects after removal of tumors in the head र neck region. Sex reassignment surgery for transsexual people is another example of reconstructive surgery. 

Plastic surgeons have developed the use of microsurgery to transfer tissue for coverage of a defect when no local tissue is available. Tissue "flaps" comprised of skin, muscle, bone, fat or a combination, may be removed from the body, moved to another site on the body र reconnected to a blood supply by suturing arteries र veins as small as 1–2 mm in diameter.

There is a definite gray area between reconstructive र cosmetic surgery. Many of the techniques of cosmetic surgery are utilized in reconstructive surgery to improve cosmesis.

Cosmetic surgery is a very popular avenue for personal enhancement, as demonstrated by the 11.9 million cosmetic procedures performed in the U.S. alone in 2004. As for any operation, cosmetic procedures involve risk, र should therefore not be undertaken lightly. Within the US, critics of plastic surgery note that it is legal for any doctor, regardless of speciality, to perform "cosmetic surgery", but not "plastic surgery". It is thus important to distinguish the terms "plastic surgery" र "cosmetic surgery": Plastic Surgery is recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (the only official entity overseeing physician certification in the United States) as the subspecialty dedicated to the surgical repair of defects of form or function—this includes cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery, as well as reconstructive surgery. The term "cosmetic surgery" however, simply refers to surgery that is designed to improve cosmetics, or appearance. (One could argue that reconstructive surgery always has some cosmetic aspect to it, because form र function are often both important in plastic surgery repairs.) Thus there is no real art of "cosmetic surgery": it is a catch-all commercial phrase that laypeople understand easily र non-plastic surgeons eagerly use because they are not allowed to use the term "plastic surgery".

Some people appear to become addicted to cosmetic surgery, possibly because of body dysmorphic disorder.

The history of cosmetic surgery reaches back to the ancient world. Physicians in ancient India including the great Indian surgeon Susrutha were utilizing skin grafts for reconstructive work as early as the 8th century BC.

This knowledge of plastic surgery existed in India up to the late 18th century as can be seen from the reports published in "Gentleman's Magazine" (October 1794). 

The Romans were able to perform simple techniques such as repairing damaged ears from around the 1st century BC. In mid-15th century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process "to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, र the dogs have devoured it" by removing skin from the back of the arm र suturing it in place.

Urology is the field of medicine that focuses on the urinary tracts of males and females , and on the reproductive system of males. In men, the urinary system overlaps with the reproductive system, and in women the urinary tract opens into the vulva. In both sexes, the urinary and reproductive tracts are close together, and disorders of one often affect the other. The organs covered by urology include the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra, and the male reproductive organs (testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis). 

The discipline combines management of medical (i.e., non-surgical) problems such as urinary infections, and surgical problems such as the correction of congenital abnormalities and the surgical management of cancers. Such abnormalities within the genital region are called genitourinary disorders.

Urologists are also involved in the assessment and treatment of incontinence. Urodynamics is the study of the pressure within the urinary system and urologists often use diagnostic techniques such as flow cystometry or ambulatory urodynamic profiles to determine the best method of treatment for the patient. This could include medical prescription (e.g. oxybutynin or multiple alpha-blockers) or surgical intervention (e.g. urethral suspension/slings).

Other subfields of urology include urologic oncology, stone disease, voiding dysfunction, pediatric urology, sexual dysfunction and male infertility.

Urology is closely related to the medical fields of nephrology, andrology, gynaecology and oncology.

Pathology (from Greek "pathos", feeling, pain, suffering; and "logos", study of; see also -ology) is the study of the processes underlying disease and other forms of illness, harmful abnormality, or dysfunction. Within biology but also a branch of medicine, it means specifically the study and diagnosis of the structural and functional changes in cells, tissues and organs that underlie disease. Pathology as a field of knowledge hence forms the basis of the scientific reasoning behind the practice of medicine. 

The primary goal of pathology is the study of the four main aspects of a disease:

Because the public rarely meets pathologists, their work is not well understood. Pathology is a large and diverse field that allows a pathologist to participate in multiple areas of the field or focus their scope to a specific area. Essential to everyday surgeries, pathologists are responsible for processing and reporting on all specimens generated during surgery. Tissue samples are taken from the submitted specimens, stained, and processed for microscopic evaluation. Microscopic examination searches for disease of any type and this information is returned to the surgeon via a pathology report. Pathologists are also responsible for laboratory specimens. They, along with medical technologists, process specimens at medical laboratories for interpretations. In other words, when a doctor refers to a "laboratory result", they are not referring to a number generated by a black box; instead, it is the interpretation of a value by a pathologist or a technologist. It is also important to understand that a different laboratory might produce a different value on the same specimen. Pathologists are also called upon to perform autopsies. Autopsies represent less than 5% of the workload of a typical modern pathologist. There exists a subspecialty in pathology that allows for the training of medical examiners who wish to pursue forensics. 

Pathologists usually do not see patients, but do on occasion such as when performing bone marrow biopsies and aspirates or fine needle aspirations of superficial nodules. Thus, it is best considered a form of diagnostic medicine. In addition to the diagnosis of disease, including cancer, and the administration of medical laboratories, pathologists often participate in the teaching of medical students (Pathology is a core course in the medical curriculum). Pathologists express their opinion as a pathology report addressed to the doctor requesting it. Since pathologists most often communicate with other doctors, they are sometimes nicknamed "the doctor's doctor". Pathology is often considered the most scientific branch of medicine because of the available avenues of research involving human material. Finally, the circulation of laboratory data is a central issue in medical informatics and the current tendency towards electronic medical records.

The techniques used most often in the study of the disease process and hence diagnosis are:

In the United States, pathologists are medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO), that have completed a four year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, and four to five years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology residency. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology:
Most pathologists seek a broad based training in both fields and thus require four years of postgraduate training known as residency. Finally, a board certification examination is required. Boarding requirements are set by the American Board of Pathology. Pathologists, like all other medical doctors, are also required to meet continuing medical education requirements.

"Pathological" is used to describe a person's actions in such a way as to credit the action to a disease process, e.g. pathological purchasing or pathological consumption, pathological narcissism, pathological liar, pathological gambling, pathological jealousy. "Pathological" is also used casually, to signify an abnormal state, e.g. a "pathological attitude" or a "pathological woman hater".

"Pathological" is also used in mathematics, physics, and statistics to describe an exceptionally (or awkwardly, or inconveniently) atypical example or set of data, often one which does not abide by rules or succumb to treatment that other similar cases usually do:

Computer science uses this term in a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be pathological if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case complexity, or even its correctness. For example, hash tables generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that collide on hash values. The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice.

Forensic Engineers often use the term to describe the underlying causes of distress in structures or machinery in order to specify repairs.



Pathology (from Greek "pathos", feeling, pain, suffering; and "logos", study of; see also -ology) is the study of the processes underlying disease and other forms of illness, harmful abnormality, or dysfunction. Within biology but also a branch of medicine, it means specifically the study and diagnosis of the structural and functional changes in cells, tissues and organs that underlie disease. Pathology as a field of knowledge hence forms the basis of the scientific reasoning behind the practice of medicine. 

The primary goal of pathology is the study of the four main aspects of a disease:

Because the public rarely meets pathologists, their work is not well understood. Pathology is a large and diverse field that allows a pathologist to participate in multiple areas of the field or focus their scope to a specific area. Essential to everyday surgeries, pathologists are responsible for processing and reporting on all specimens generated during surgery. Tissue samples are taken from the submitted specimens, stained, and processed for microscopic evaluation. Microscopic examination searches for disease of any type and this information is returned to the surgeon via a pathology report. Pathologists are also responsible for laboratory specimens. They, along with medical technologists, process specimens at medical laboratories for interpretations. In other words, when a doctor refers to a "laboratory result", they are not referring to a number generated by a black box; instead, it is the interpretation of a value by a pathologist or a technologist. It is also important to understand that a different laboratory might produce a different value on the same specimen. Pathologists are also called upon to perform autopsies. Autopsies represent less than 5% of the workload of a typical modern pathologist. There exists a subspecialty in pathology that allows for the training of medical examiners who wish to pursue forensics. 

Pathologists usually do not see patients, but do on occasion such as when performing bone marrow biopsies and aspirates or fine needle aspirations of superficial nodules. Thus, it is best considered a form of diagnostic medicine. In addition to the diagnosis of disease, including cancer, and the administration of medical laboratories, pathologists often participate in the teaching of medical students (Pathology is a core course in the medical curriculum). Pathologists express their opinion as a pathology report addressed to the doctor requesting it. Since pathologists most often communicate with other doctors, they are sometimes nicknamed "the doctor's doctor". Pathology is often considered the most scientific branch of medicine because of the available avenues of research involving human material. Finally, the circulation of laboratory data is a central issue in medical informatics and the current tendency towards electronic medical records.

The techniques used most often in the study of the disease process and hence diagnosis are:

Microscopic examination searches for disease of any type र this information is returned to the surgeon via a pathology report. Pathologists are also responsible for laboratory specimens. They, along with medical technologists, process specimens at medical laboratories for interpretations. In other words, when a doctor refers to a "laboratory result", they are not referring to a number generated by a black box; instead, it is the interpretation of a value by a pathologist or a technologist. It is also important to understand that a different laboratory might produce a different value on the same specimen. Pathologists are also called upon to perform autopsies. Autopsies represent less than 5% of the workload of a typical modern pathologist. There exists a subspecialty in pathology that allows for the training of medical examiners who wish to pursue forensics. 

Pathologists usually do not see patients, but do on occasion such as when performing bone marrow biopsies र aspirates or fine needle aspirations of superficial nodules. Thus, it is best considered a form of diagnostic medicine. In addition to the diagnosis of disease, including cancer, र the administration of medical laboratories, pathologists often participate in the teaching of medical students (Pathology is a core course in the medical curriculum). Pathologists express their opinion as a pathology report addressed to the doctor requesting it. Since pathologists most often communicate with other doctors, they are sometimes nicknamed "the doctor's doctor". Pathology is often considered the most scientific branch of medicine because of the available avenues of research involving human material. Finally, the circulation of laboratory data is a central issue in medical informatics र the current tendency towards electronic medical records.

The techniques used most often in the study of the disease process र hence diagnosis are:

In the United States, pathologists are medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO), that have completed a four year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, र four to five years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology residency. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology:
Most pathologists seek a broad based training in both fields र thus require four years of postgraduate training known as residency. Finally, a board certification examination is required. Boarding requirements are set by the American Board of Pathology. Pathologists, like all other medical doctors, are also required to meet continuing medical education requirements.

"Pathological" is used to describe a person's actions in such a way as to credit the action to a disease process, e.g. pathological purchasing or pathological consumption, pathological narcissism, pathological liar, pathological gambling, pathological jealousy. "Pathological" is also used casually, to signify an abnormal state, e.g. a "pathological attitude" or a "pathological woman hater".

"Pathological" is also used in mathematics, physics, र statistics to describe an exceptionally (or awkwardly, or inconveniently) atypical example or set of data, often one which does not abide by rules or succumb to treatment that other similar cases usually do:

Computer science uses this term in a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be pathological if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case complexity, or even its correctness. For example, hash tables generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that collide on hash values. The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice.

Forensic Engineers often use the term to describe the underlying causes of distress in structures or machinery in order to specify repairs.



Pathology (from Greek "pathos", feeling, pain, suffering; र "logos", study of; see also -ology) is the study of the processes underlying disease र other forms of illness, harmful abnormality, or dysfunction. Within biology but also a branch of medicine, it means specifically the study र diagnosis of the structural र functional changes in cells, tissues र organs that underlie disease. Pathology as a field of knowledge hence forms the basis of the scientific reasoning behind the practice of medicine.

"Pathological" is also used in mathematics, physics, र statistics to describe an exceptionally (or awkwardly, or inconveniently) atypical example or set of data, often one which does not abide by rules or succumb to treatment that other similar cases usually do:

Computer science uses this term in a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be pathological if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case complexity, or even its correctness. For example, hash tables generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that collide on hash values. The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice.

Forensic Engineers often use the term to describe the underlying causes of distress in structures or machinery in order to specify repairs.



Pathology (from Greek "pathos", feeling, pain, suffering; र "logos", study of; see also -ology) is the study of the processes underlying disease र other forms of illness, harmful abnormality, or dysfunction. Within biology but also a branch of medicine, it means specifically the study र diagnosis of the structural र functional changes in cells, tissues र organs that underlie disease. Pathology as a field of knowledge hence forms the basis of the scientific reasoning behind the practice of medicine. 

The primary goal of pathology is the study of the four main aspects of a disease:

Because the public rarely meets pathologists, their work is not well understood. Pathology is a large र diverse field that allows a pathologist to participate in multiple areas of the field or focus their scope to a specific area. Essential to everyday surgeries, pathologists are responsible for processing र reporting on all specimens generated during surgery. Tissue samples are taken from the submitted specimens, stained, र processed for microscopic evaluation. Microscopic examination searches for disease of any type र this information is returned to the surgeon via a pathology report. Pathologists are also responsible for laboratory specimens. They, along with medical technologists, process specimens at medical laboratories for interpretations. In other words, when a doctor refers to a "laboratory result", they are not referring to a number generated by a black box; instead, it is the interpretation of a value by a pathologist or a technologist. It is also important to understand that a different laboratory might produce a different value on the same specimen. Pathologists are also called upon to perform autopsies. Autopsies represent less than 5% of the workload of a typical modern pathologist. There exists a subspecialty in pathology that allows for the training of medical examiners who wish to pursue forensics. 

Pathologists usually do not see patients, but do on occasion such as when performing bone marrow biopsies र aspirates or fine needle aspirations of superficial nodules. Thus, it is best considered a form of diagnostic medicine. In addition to the diagnosis of disease, including cancer, र the administration of medical laboratories, pathologists often participate in the teaching of medical students (Pathology is a core course in the medical curriculum). Pathologists express their opinion as a pathology report addressed to the doctor requesting it. Since pathologists most often communicate with other doctors, they are sometimes nicknamed "the doctor's doctor". Pathology is often considered the most scientific branch of medicine because of the available avenues of research involving human material. Finally, the circulation of laboratory data is a central issue in medical informatics र the current tendency towards electronic medical records.

The techniques used most often in the study of the disease process र hence diagnosis are:

In the United States, pathologists are medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO), that have completed a four year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, र four to five years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology residency. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology:
Most pathologists seek a broad based training in both fields र thus require four years of postgraduate training known as residency. Finally, a board certification examination is required. Boarding requirements are set by the American Board of Pathology. Pathologists, like all other medical doctors, are also required to meet continuing medical education requirements.

Pathologists usually do not see patients, but do on occasion such as when performing bone marrow biopsies र aspirates or fine needle aspirations of superficial nodules. Thus, it is best considered a form of diagnostic medicine. In addition to the diagnosis of disease, including cancer, र the administration of medical laboratories, pathologists often participate in the teaching of medical students (Pathology is a core course in the medical curriculum). Pathologists express their opinion as a pathology report addressed to the doctor requesting it. Since pathologists most often communicate with other doctors, they are sometimes nicknamed "the doctor's doctor". Pathology is often considered the most scientific branch of medicine because of the available avenues of research involving human material. Finally, the circulation of laboratory data is a central issue in medical informatics र the current tendency towards electronic medical records.

In the United States, pathologists are medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO), that have completed a four year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, र four to five years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology residency. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology:
Most pathologists seek a broad based training in both fields र thus require four years of postgraduate training known as residency. Finally, a board certification examination is required.

"Pathological" is used to describe a person's actions in such a way as to credit the action to a disease process, e.g. pathological purchasing or pathological consumption, pathological narcissism, pathological liar, pathological gambling, pathological jealousy. "Pathological" is also used casually, to signify an abnormal state, e.g. a "pathological attitude" or a "pathological woman hater".

"Pathological" is also used in mathematics, physics, र statistics to describe an exceptionally (or awkwardly, or inconveniently) atypical example or set of data, often one which does not abide by rules or succumb to treatment that other similar cases usually do:

Computer science uses this term in a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be pathological if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case complexity, or even its correctness. For example, hash tables generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that collide on hash values. The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice.

Forensic Engineers often use the term to describe the underlying causes of distress in structures or machinery in order to specify repairs.



 
Pathology (from Greek "pathos", feeling, pain, suffering; र "logos", study of; see also -ology) is the study of the processes underlying disease र other forms of illness, harmful abnormality, or dysfunction. Within biology but also a branch of medicine, it means specifically the study र diagnosis of the structural र functional changes in cells, tissues र organs that underlie disease. Pathology as a field of knowledge hence forms the basis of the scientific reasoning behind the practice of medicine. 

The primary goal of pathology is the study of the four main aspects of a disease:

Because the public rarely meets pathologists, their work is not well understood. Pathology is a large र diverse field that allows a pathologist to participate in multiple areas of the field or focus their scope to a specific area. Essential to everyday surgeries, pathologists are responsible for processing र reporting on all specimens generated during surgery. Tissue samples are taken from the submitted specimens, stained, र processed for microscopic evaluation. Microscopic examination searches for disease of any type र this information is returned to the surgeon via a pathology report. Pathologists are also responsible for laboratory specimens. They, along with medical technologists, process specimens at medical laboratories for interpretations. In other words, when a doctor refers to a "laboratory result", they are not referring to a number generated by a black box; instead, it is the interpretation of a value by a pathologist or a technologist. It is also important to understand that a different laboratory might produce a different value on the same specimen. Pathologists are also called upon to perform autopsies.

Forensic Engineers often use the term to describe the underlying causes of distress in structures or machinery in order to specify repairs.



Pathology (from Greek "pathos", feeling, pain, suffering; र "logos", study of; see also -ology) is the study of the processes underlying disease र other forms of illness, harmful abnormality, or dysfunction. Within biology but also a branch of medicine, it means specifically the study र diagnosis of the structural र functional changes in cells, tissues र organs that underlie disease. Pathology as a field of knowledge hence forms the basis of the scientific reasoning behind the practice of medicine. 

The primary goal of pathology is the study of the four main aspects of a disease:

Because the public rarely meets pathologists, their work is not well understood. Pathology is a large र diverse field that allows a pathologist to participate in multiple areas of the field or focus their scope to a specific area. Essential to everyday surgeries, pathologists are responsible for processing र reporting on all specimens generated during surgery. Tissue samples are taken from the submitted specimens, stained, र processed for microscopic evaluation. Microscopic examination searches for disease of any type र this information is returned to the surgeon via a pathology report. Pathologists are also responsible for laboratory specimens. They, along with medical technologists, process specimens at medical laboratories for interpretations. In other words, when a doctor refers to a "laboratory result", they are not referring to a number generated by a black box; instead, it is the interpretation of a value by a pathologist or a technologist. It is also important to understand that a different laboratory might produce a different value on the same specimen. Pathologists are also called upon to perform autopsies. Autopsies represent less than 5% of the workload of a typical modern pathologist. There exists a subspecialty in pathology that allows for the training of medical examiners who wish to pursue forensics. 

Pathologists usually do not see patients, but do on occasion such as when performing bone marrow biopsies र aspirates or fine needle aspirations of superficial nodules. Thus, it is best considered a form of diagnostic medicine. In addition to the diagnosis of disease, including cancer, र the administration of medical laboratories, pathologists often participate in the teaching of medical students (Pathology is a core course in the medical curriculum). Pathologists express their opinion as a pathology report addressed to the doctor requesting it. Since pathologists most often communicate with other doctors, they are sometimes nicknamed "the doctor's doctor". Pathology is often considered the most scientific branch of medicine because of the available avenues of research involving human material. Finally, the circulation of laboratory data is a central issue in medical informatics र the current tendency towards electronic medical records.

The techniques used most often in the study of the disease process र hence diagnosis are:

In the United States, pathologists are medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO), that have completed a four year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, र four to five years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology residency. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology:
Most pathologists seek a broad based training in both fields र thus require four years of postgraduate training known as residency. Finally, a board certification examination is required. Boarding requirements are set by the American Board of Pathology. Pathologists, like all other medical doctors, are also required to meet continuing medical education requirements.

"Pathological" is used to describe a person's actions in such a way as to credit the action to a disease process, e.g. pathological purchasing or pathological consumption, pathological narcissism, pathological liar, pathological gambling, pathological jealousy. "Pathological" is also used casually, to signify an abnormal state, e.g. a "pathological attitude" or a "pathological woman hater".

"Pathological" is also used in mathematics, physics, र statistics to describe an exceptionally (or awkwardly, or inconveniently) atypical example or set of data, often one which does not abide by rules or succumb to treatment that other similar cases usually do:

Computer science uses this term in a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be pathological if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case complexity, or even its correctness. For example, hash tables generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that collide on hash values. The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice.

In the United States, pathologists are medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO), that have completed a four year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, र four to five years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology residency.

"Pathological" is used to describe a person's actions in such a way as to credit the action to a disease process, e.g. pathological purchasing or pathological consumption, pathological narcissism, pathological liar, pathological gambling, pathological jealousy. "Pathological" is also used casually, to signify an abnormal state, e.g. a "pathological attitude" or a "pathological woman hater".

"Pathological" is also used in mathematics, physics, र statistics to describe an exceptionally (or awkwardly, or inconveniently) atypical example or set of data, often one which does not abide by rules or succumb to treatment that other similar cases usually do:

Computer science uses this term in a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be pathological if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case complexity, or even its correctness. For example, hash tables generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that collide on hash values. The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice.

Forensic Engineers often use the term to describe the underlying causes of distress in structures or machinery in order to specify repairs.



Pathology (from Greek "pathos", feeling, pain, suffering; र "logos", study of; see also -ology) is the study of the processes underlying disease र other forms of illness, harmful abnormality, or dysfunction. Within biology but also a branch of medicine, it means specifically the study र diagnosis of the structural र functional changes in cells, tissues र organs that underlie disease. Pathology as a field of knowledge hence forms the basis of the scientific reasoning behind the practice of medicine. 

The primary goal of pathology is the study of the four main aspects of a disease:

Because the public rarely meets pathologists, their work is not well understood. Pathology is a large र diverse field that allows a pathologist to participate in multiple areas of the field or focus their scope to a specific area. Essential to everyday surgeries, pathologists are responsible for processing र reporting on all specimens generated during surgery. Tissue samples are taken from the submitted specimens, stained, र processed for microscopic evaluation. Microscopic examination searches for disease of any type र this information is returned to the surgeon via a pathology report. Pathologists are also responsible for laboratory specimens. They, along with medical technologists, process specimens at medical laboratories for interpretations. In other words, when a doctor refers to a "laboratory result", they are not referring to a number generated by a black box; instead, it is the interpretation of a value by a pathologist or a technologist. It is also important to understand that a different laboratory might produce a different value on the same specimen. Pathologists are also called upon to perform autopsies. Autopsies represent less than 5% of the workload of a typical modern pathologist. There exists a subspecialty in pathology that allows for the training of medical examiners who wish to pursue forensics. 

Pathologists usually do not see patients, but do on occasion such as when performing bone marrow biopsies र aspirates or fine needle aspirations of superficial nodules. Thus, it is best considered a form of diagnostic medicine. In addition to the diagnosis of disease, including cancer, र the administration of medical laboratories, pathologists often participate in the teaching of medical students (Pathology is a core course in the medical curriculum). Pathologists express their opinion as a pathology report addressed to the doctor requesting it. Since pathologists most often communicate with other doctors, they are sometimes nicknamed "the doctor's doctor". Pathology is often considered the most scientific branch of medicine because of the available avenues of research involving human material. Finally, the circulation of laboratory data is a central issue in medical informatics र the current tendency towards electronic medical records.

Essential to everyday surgeries, pathologists are responsible for processing र reporting on all specimens generated during surgery. Tissue samples are taken from the submitted specimens, stained, र processed for microscopic evaluation. Microscopic examination searches for disease of any type र this information is returned to the surgeon via a pathology report. Pathologists are also responsible for laboratory specimens. They, along with medical technologists, process specimens at medical laboratories for interpretations. In other words, when a doctor refers to a "laboratory result", they are not referring to a number generated by a black box; instead, it is the interpretation of a value by a pathologist or a technologist. It is also important to understand that a different laboratory might produce a different value on the same specimen. Pathologists are also called upon to perform autopsies. Autopsies represent less than 5% of the workload of a typical modern pathologist. There exists a subspecialty in pathology that allows for the training of medical examiners who wish to pursue forensics. 

Pathologists usually do not see patients, but do on occasion such as when performing bone marrow biopsies र aspirates or fine needle aspirations of superficial nodules. Thus, it is best considered a form of diagnostic medicine. In addition to the diagnosis of disease, including cancer, र the administration of medical laboratories, pathologists often participate in the teaching of medical students (Pathology is a core course in the medical curriculum). Pathologists express their opinion as a pathology report addressed to the doctor requesting it. Since pathologists most often communicate with other doctors, they are sometimes nicknamed "the doctor's doctor". Pathology is often considered the most scientific branch of medicine because of the available avenues of research involving human material. Finally, the circulation of laboratory data is a central issue in medical informatics र the current tendency towards electronic medical records.

The techniques used most often in the study of the disease process र hence diagnosis are:

In the United States, pathologists are medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO), that have completed a four year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, र four to five years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology residency. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology:
Most pathologists seek a broad based training in both fields र thus require four years of postgraduate training known as residency. Finally, a board certification examination is required. Boarding requirements are set by the American Board of Pathology. Pathologists, like all other medical doctors, are also required to meet continuing medical education requirements.

The American Board of Oral र maxillofacial pathology certifies dentistry doctors, not medical doctors, to practice this sub-specialty of Pathology.




"Pathological" is used to describe a person's actions in such a way as to credit the action to a disease process, e.g. pathological purchasing or pathological consumption, pathological narcissism, pathological liar, pathological gambling, pathological jealousy. "Pathological" is also used casually, to signify an abnormal state, e.g. a "pathological attitude" or a "pathological woman hater".

"Pathological" is also used in mathematics, physics, र statistics to describe an exceptionally (or awkwardly, or inconveniently) atypical example or set of data, often one which does not abide by rules or succumb to treatment that other similar cases usually do:

Computer science uses this term in a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be pathological if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case complexity, or even its correctness. For example, hash tables generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that collide on hash values. The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice.

Forensic Engineers often use the term to describe the underlying causes of distress in structures or machinery in order to specify repairs.



 
Pathology (from Greek "pathos", feeling, pain, suffering; र "logos", study of; see also -ology) is the study of the processes underlying disease र other forms of illness, harmful abnormality, or dysfunction. Within biology but also a branch of medicine, it means specifically the study र diagnosis of the structural र functional changes in cells, tissues र organs that underlie disease. Pathology as a field of knowledge hence forms the basis of the scientific reasoning behind the practice of medicine. 

The primary goal of pathology is the study of the four main aspects of a disease:
