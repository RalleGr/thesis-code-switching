In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century and 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, and the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before his title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, and "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", and is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of his time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of his lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon his earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 and then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India and has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, his monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the government of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama and the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child and his family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, and all attempts by members of the EU parliament and US government to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, and has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of his repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish his work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama and until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, and in the summer at the Norbulingka palace and park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama and his fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed and opened many schools and Buddhist temples in Dharamsala.

Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century and 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, and the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before his title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, and "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", and is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of his time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of his lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon his earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 and then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India and has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, his monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the government of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama and the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child and his family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, and all attempts by members of the EU parliament and US government to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, and has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of his repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish his work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama and until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, and in the summer at the Norbulingka palace and park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama and his fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed and opened many schools and Buddhist temples in Dharamsala.

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama र उनका fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed र opened many schools र Buddhist temples in Dharamsala.

Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama र उनका fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century र 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama र उनका fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed र opened many schools र Buddhist temples in Dharamsala.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century र 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama र उनका fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed र opened many schools र Buddhist temples in Dharamsala.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century र 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama र उनका fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century र 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century र 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama.

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century र 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century र 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century र 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama र उनका fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed र opened many schools र Buddhist temples in Dharamsala.

The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug sect, but this position officially belongs to the Ganden Tripa (). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche () meaning "Precious Victor," or Yishin Norbu () meaning "Wish-fulfilling Jewel".

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama र उनका fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed र opened many schools र Buddhist temples in Dharamsala.

"Dalai" means "ocean" in Mongolian, र "Lama" ("bla ma") is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word "guru", र is commonly translated to mean "spiritual teacher". The actual title was first bestowed by the Mongolian ruler Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578. He was an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of उनका time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title "Dalai Lama", due to the fact that he was the third member of उनका lineage, he became known as the "3rd Dalai Lama". The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon उनका earlier incarnations. Five Dalai Lamas were murdered by their Buddhist courtiers within 170 years.

The 5th Dalai Lama, with the support of Gushri Khan, a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet. The Dalai Lamas continued to partially rule in Tibet with, to some extent, autonomic power given by contemporary Chinese governments, until the People's Republic of China invaded the region in 1949 र then took full control in 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to India र has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current 14th Dalai Lama seeks greater autonomy for Tibet.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama"). 

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama र उनका fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed र opened many schools र Buddhist temples in Dharamsala.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (; ) form a lineage of allegedly reborn (tulku) magistrates which traces back to 1391. They are of the Gelug sect of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be one of innumerable incarnations of Avalokiteśvara ("Chenrezig" ["spyan ras gzigs"] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century र 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, administering a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lama is considered the supreme head of Tibetan Buddhism, र the leaders of all four schools consider the Dalai Lama to be the highest lama of the Tibetan traditions. He is often styled "His Holiness" (HH) before उनका title.

The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child र उनका family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The 14th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India. The then Indian Prime Minister, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama र उनका fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since been in refuge in , in the state of Himachal Pradesh in , where the (The Tibetan Government in Exile) is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed र opened many schools र Buddhist temples in Dharamsala.

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the 15th Dalai Lama").

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls.

However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly.

अहिलेसम्म १४ वटा दलाई लामाहरू भएका छन्।




दलाई लामा तिब्बती बौद्ध धर्मगुरू हुन्। 
तिब्बत चीनको अधिनमा हुनुपुर्व दलाई लामा तिब्बतका शासक हुने गर्थे।

मंगोलियन भाषामा दलाईको अर्थ समुन्द्र र लामाको अर्थ गुरू हुन्छ। दलाई लामाको अर्थ अध्यात्मिक गुरू भन्ने लाग्छ।

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The १४th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the १५th Dalai Lama").

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child and his family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC.

प्रथम दलाई लामा ( गेदुन-ड्रुप )
दलाई लामा परम्परा महा-गुरु जे-शोङखापाको शिक्षामा आधारित टासिलुन्पो मठका प्रथम मठाधिस परम-पावन गेदुन-ड्रुपबाट शुरु भएको इतिहास पाईन्छ । उनको जन्म ई.सं १३९१ मा तिब्बतको साब्टोड मा भएको थियो । उनी महा-गुरु जे-शोङखापाका चौथो शिष्य थिए । उनले महा-गुरु जे-शोङखापा द्वारा प्रतिपादित कादम विचार धारालाई वादका रुपमा व्यापक प्रचार प्रशार गरे र कादम सम्प्रदायको विकासमा अतुलनिय योगदान गरे । उनैले पछि टासिलुन्पो विहार बनाए र त्यसलाई कादम सप्रदायको प्रमुख शिक्षा केन्द्रको रुपमा विकाश गरे । उनले ८४ वर्षको उमेरमा तिब्बतको नार्थाङमा परिनिर्वाण प्राप्त गरे। उनको अस्तु-धातु युक्त चैत्य यधपी नार्थाङ विहारमा दर्शन गर्न सकिन्छ ।

दोस्रो दलाई लामा (गेदुन ग्यात्सो)
पहिलो दलाई लामा परम-पावन गेदुन ड्रुपको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात गेदुन ग्यात्सोलाई दोस्रो दलाई लामाको रुपमा चयन गरियो । उनको जन्म ई.स १४७५ मा तिब्बतको सांगमा भएको थियो ।उनले आफ्नो शासनकालमा गेलुक सम्प्रदायलाई अझ विशाल र प्रशिद्ध बनाए । उनले भिक्षुहरुलाई शिल र विनयको विकाशका लागि उच्च जोड दिन्थे । उनले ई.स १५४७ मा परिनिर्वाण प्राप्त गरे ।

तेस्रो दलाई लामा (सोनाम ग्यात्सो )
दोस्रो दलाई लामाको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात सोनाम ग्यात्सोलाई तेस्रो दलाई लामाको रुपमा चयन गरियो । उनको जन्म, उनका पुर्वज गेदुन ग्यात्सोले भविष्यवाणी गरे अनुरुप ई.स १५४३ मा तिब्बतको ल्हासा शहर नजिक भएको थियो । उनलाई तात्कालिन मंगोलियाका नरेश अल्तान खांले धर्म श्रवणको लागि आग्रह गरे पश्चात,उनले सन १५७७ मा मंगोलियाको भ्रमण गरि नरेशलाई बौद्ध धर्मको ज्ञान गराए , उनीबाट प्रेरित भएर मंगोलियन नरेशले बौद्ध धर्मलाई राष्ट्रिय धर्मको रुपमा अंगाले र सोनाम ग्यात्सोलाई समुन्द्र जस्तो विशाल हृदय भएका गुरु अर्थात दलाई लामाको उपाधी दिए जसलाई उनका पछिल्ला दुई अवतारका लागि पनि ग्रहण गरियो । उनले ई.स १५८८ मा परिनिर्वाण प्राप्त गरे ।

चौथो दलाई लामा ( योन्तान ग्यात्सो )
तेस्रो दलाई लामाको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात योन्तान ग्यात्सोलाई चौथो दलाई लामाको रुपमा चयन गरियो । उनको जन्म ई.स १५८९ मा मंगोलियन शाही घरानामा भएको थियो । उनि पहिलो गैहृ तिब्बती दलाई लामा हुन । उनले ई.स १६१६ मा परिनिर्वाण प्राप्त गरे ।

पाचौ दलाई लामा (लोब्सांग ग्यात्सो )
चौथो दलाई लामाको परिनिर्वाण पश्चात लोब्सांग ग्यात्सोलाई पाचौँ दलाई लामाको रुपमा चयन गरियो । उनको जन्म ई.स १६१७ भएको थियो । उनले विभीन्न भू-खण्डमा टुक्रिएको तिब्बतको एकिकरण गरि एकिकृत तिब्बतका प्रथम प्रशासकिय तथा धार्मिक नेताका रुपमा तिब्बतमा शासन गरे । उनले तिब्बती सरकार र दलाई लामाको प्रधान निवासका रुपमा पोताला दरबारको निर्माण गराए। उनले तिब्बतमा शिक्षा तथा स्वास्थको क्षेत्रमा उल्लेखनिय कार्य गरेका कारण स्थानिय तिब्बतीहरुले उनलाई महान पाचौँका रपमा पनि सम्बोधन गर्दछन । उनले ई.स १६८२ मा परिनिर्वाण प्राप्त गरे ।

The title "Dalai Lama" is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's successive incarnations (for example, The १४th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title "the १५th Dalai Lama").

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, उनका monks institute a search for the Lama's reincarnation, or "yangsi" ("yang srid"), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation. The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas.

Despite its officially secular stance, the सरकार of the People's Republic of China has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet. This decision cites a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama र the Panchen Lama by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls. Controversially, this precedent was called upon by the PRC to name their own Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama र the majority of Tibetan Buddhists in exile do not regard this to be the legitimate Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has recognized a different child, Gendan Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. This child and his family have been taken into 'protective custody' according to the PRC, र all attempts by members of the EU parliament र US सरकार to garner guarantees of the families safety have been denied by the PRC. There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the People's Republic of China will attempt to direct the selection of a successor, using the authority of their chosen Panchen Lama.

The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, र has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of उनका repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish उनका work. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. The १४th Dalai Lama has stated, "Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose."

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama र until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided during winter at the Potala Palace, र in the summer at the Norbulingka palace र park. Both residences are located in Lhasa, Tibet, approximately 3 km apart. In 1959, subsequent to the then ongoing Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge within India.
