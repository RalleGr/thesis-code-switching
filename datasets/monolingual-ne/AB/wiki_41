नेपालको इतिहास

The History of Nepal is characterized by its isolated position in the Himalayas and its two dominant neighbors, India and China. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The toponym "Nepal" may derive from the Sanskrit "nipalaya", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the Himalayas. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the Tibetan "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

Neolithic tools found in the Kathmandu Valley indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the Mahabharata mention the "Kiratas", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of Tibeto-Burman ethnicity lived in Nepal 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur in Nepal, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture in Nepal at that period.

Indo-Aryan tribes began arriving around 1500 BCE from the northwest. Around 1000 BCE, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the Shakya clan, whose capital was Kapilavastu, near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was Siddharta Gautama (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "Buddha" ("the enlightened one"). By 260 BCE, most of northern India was ruled by the Maurya Empire. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of Ashoka the Great—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from 273 to 232 BCE and a convert to Buddhism—have been found in the Kathmandu Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the Gupta Empire. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the Guptas, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about 400 and 750 AD, Nepal's present capital Kathmandu was ruled by the Licchavi kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, Åšaka era has an epoch corresponding to 78 AD, whereas the latter Aṃshuvarmā or Mānadeva 2 era reckons from 576.

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of stonework construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the Kirata. Of these people very little is known.

The Licchavi rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in Sanskrit—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in 733. The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late eighth century and was followed by a Newari era, from 879, although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late 11th century, southern Nepal came under the influence of the Chalukaya Empire of southern India. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early 12th century, leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). Arimalla was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

Thirteenth-century Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the Delhi Sultanate of northern India, and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late 14th century much of the country came under the rule of the king Jayasthitimalla, who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in 1482 the kingdom was carved into three: Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhadgaon. 

Modern Nepal was created in the latter half of the 18th century when Prithvi Narayan Shah, the ruler of the small principality of Gorkha, formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the Gorkha Kingdom. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, Prithvi Narayan Shah dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the Kathmandu valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in 1768. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked Sikkim many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital Rabdentse by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to Tibet. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed Tashilhunpo Monastery of Shigatse. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor Qianlong dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the British East India Company over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The Treaty of Sugauli was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and Sikkim to the British in exchange for Nepalese autonomy.

Factionalism among the royal family led to a period of instability after the war. In 1846, Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow Jang Bahadur, a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the Kot Massacre. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the Rana lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized autocracy, pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857, and later in both World Wars. 

In 1923 Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late 1940s. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in 1950, India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability in Nepal. Forced to act, India sponsored both King Tribhuvan as Nepal's new ruler in 1951, and a new government, mostly comprising the Nepali Congress Party. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King Mahendra and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in 1960. In 1962 he declared that a "partyless" panchayat system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in 1950, King Tribhuvan, a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent India, touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early 1959, King Mahendra issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The Nepali Congress Party, a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. Koirala, formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on December 16, 1962. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a Rastriya Panchayat (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King Birendra, in 1972. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in 1979, King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. Jana Andolan forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May 1991, Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new Congress government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A general strike was called for April 6.

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside Bir Hospital when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on April 6, clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok (Patan) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital Kathmandu was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the Nepal Telecommunications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The Human Rights Organisation of Nepal estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the Maoist parties started a bid to replace the parliamentary monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the people's war, which has led to the Nepalese Civil War. Led by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai and Pushpa Kamal Dahal (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: Rolpa, Rukum, Jajarkot, Gorkha, and Sindhuli. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince Dipendra went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince Gyanendra (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince Paras.

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On 2005-02-01, Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "state of emergency" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under house arrest, phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 strikes and street protests in Kathmandu forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of 15 January 2007 Nepal is governed by an unicameral legislature under an interim constitution.

Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture in Nepal at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the Kathmandu Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[Kathmandu]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[Kathmandu]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the Kathmandu valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by her Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability in Nepal. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[Kathmandu]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

massaacre was not done by prince dipendra. rather he was killed as well. but he killer is still unknown

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived in Nepal 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur in Nepal, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture in Nepal at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region.

The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived in Nepal 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur in Nepal, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture in Nepal at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the Kathmandu Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[Kathmandu]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[Kathmandu]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the Kathmandu valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by her Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability in Nepal. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[Kathmandu]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[Kathmandu]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[sv:Nepals historia]]
[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived in Nepal 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur in Nepal, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture in Nepal at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the Kathmandu Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[Kathmandu]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[Kathmandu]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the Kathmandu valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by her Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability in Nepal. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[Kathmandu]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[Kathmandu]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived in Nepal 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur in Nepal, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture in Nepal at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the Kathmandu Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[Kathmandu]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[Kathmandu]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the Kathmandu valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by her Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability in Nepal. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country.

Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability in Nepal. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[Kathmandu]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the Kathmandu Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[Kathmandu]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[Kathmandu]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the Kathmandu valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived in Nepal 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur in Nepal, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture in Nepal at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the Kathmandu Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[Kathmandu]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[Kathmandu]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the Kathmandu valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by her Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability in Nepal. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[Kathmandu]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[????????]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the ???????? Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in ????????]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived in Nepal 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur in Nepal, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture in Nepal at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the Kathmandu Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[Kathmandu]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[Kathmandu]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the Kathmandu valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by her Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability in Nepal. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[Kathmandu]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]].

The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived नेपालमा 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur नेपालमा, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture नेपालमा at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by her Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा.

The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala government and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first government in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes and street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived नेपालमा 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur नेपालमा, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture नेपालमा at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal.

The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]].

Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by her Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled his "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes and street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार and stripped the king of most of his powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived नेपालमा 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur नेपालमा, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture नेपालमा at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]].

A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार and stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s and its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] and [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, and experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool and PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool and the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived नेपालमा 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur नेपालमा, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture नेपालमा at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] and a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] and [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates and commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, and the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; and the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] and was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], and was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], and [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley and the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 and 1733, the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai and [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, and assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], and later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, and was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school and colleges, and from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" and "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military and popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार and served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार and promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy and all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes and street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार and stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists and police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, and the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" and "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार and took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार and assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election and some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes and street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार and stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, and it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived नेपालमा 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur नेपालमा, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture नेपालमा at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊爾歷史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived नेपालमा 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur नेपालमा, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture नेपालमा at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]].

In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

[[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊尔历史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived नेपालमा 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur नेपालमा, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture नेपालमा at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain.

Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊尔历史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived नेपालमा 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur नेपालमा, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture नेपालमा at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years. 

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊尔历史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Neolithic]] tools found in the [[काठमाण्डौ उपत्यका]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 9,000 years. Documented references reach back to the first millennium BCE, when ancient Indian epics such as the [[महाभारत]] mention the "[[किराँत]]", the inhabitants of Nepal. It appears that people who were probably of [[भोट-बर्मेली]] ethnicity lived नेपालमा 2,500 years ago. Ramayana, which refers to the era before Mahabharat, states Mithila, which is currently known as Janakpur नेपालमा, as the birth place of goddess Sita. Also, the presence of historical sites, e.g., Valmik ashram, indicates the presence of Aryan culture नेपालमा at that period.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

[[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s. 

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊尔历史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊尔历史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

[[zh:尼泊尔历史]]The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

नेपालको इतिहास The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

नेपालको इतिहास The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

नेपालको इतिहास The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes began arriving around [[1500 BCE]] from the northwest. Around [[1000 BCE]], small kingdoms र confederations of clans arose in the region. One of the earliest confederations was that of the [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was [[Kapilavastu]], near the present-day border with India. One of its princes was [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta Gautama]] (563–483 BCE), who renounced उनका royalty to lead an ascetic life र came to be known as the "[[Buddha]]" ("the enlightened one"). By [[260 BCE]], most of [[North India|northern India]] was ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]]. Although not all of Nepal was under Maurya rule, there is evidence of at least the influence of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]—the ruler of the Maurya Empire from [[273 BCE|273]] to [[232 BCE]] र a convert to [[Buddhism]]—have been found in the काठमाडौं Valley. In the fourth century CE, the area fell under the [[Gupta Empire]]. Though all of Nepal wasn't under the direct control of the [[Gupta]]s, they have had an influence on its culture.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]].

Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

नेपालको इतिहास The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "[[नेपाल]]" may derive from the [[संस्कृत]] 'निपालय", which means "at the foot of the mountains" or "abode at the foot," a reference to its location in relation to the [[हिमालय]]. Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

नेपालको इतिहास The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

"[[नेपाल]]" नामित शब्दको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]]को 'निपालय" बाट भयेको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ हो "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास," यस स्थानको एउटा सन्दर्म हिमालसंग सम्बन्धित छ। Thus, it may be an Eastern equivalent of the European toponym "Piedmont." It has also been suggested that the name comes from the [[तिब्बती भाषा] "niyampal", which means "holy land". A third theory suggests that Nepal came from the word NE which means wool र PAL means tented house. Long time ago, Nepal used to produce a lot of wool र the houses were used to store the wool, hence the word NE-PAL

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom.

On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

नेपालको इतिहास The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom.

The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

नेपालको इतिहास The History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces.

The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain.

एशियाका ठूला देशहरु चीन र भारतको बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरुको भन्दा भिन्न छ, नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपटि रहेका देशहरु विदेशी कब्जामा परिThe History of [[नेपाल]] is characterized by its isolated position in the [[हिमालय]]s र its two dominant neighbors, [[भारत]] र [[चीन]]. Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government--either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom|Nepal Telecommunications]] building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom.

तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister.

Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[नेपाल|Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[नेपाल|Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]].

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[नेपाल|Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[नेपाल|Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १८ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा दरवारमै उपस्थित रहेका ज्ञानेन्द्र पुत्र पारसले हत्या गरेको र यसमा ज्ञानेन्द्रको पनि संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
अरू सबैको विभत्स हत्या हुनु र ज्ञानेन्द्र परिवार मात्र सकुशल बाँच्नुले यो कुराको थप पुष्टि गरेको छ।

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Even though it was independent through most of its history, it was split in three from the 15th to 18th century. It was united as a monarchy, र experienced a failed struggle for democracy in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the country is in civil strife.

Between about [[400]] र [[750]] AD, [[नेपाल|Nepal]]'s present capital [[काठमाडौं]] was ruled by the [[Licchavi]] kingdom. Archaeological evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand".

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राहधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी]] हरूले शासन गर्दथे। evidence for this period mainly consists of stonework inscriptions, reckoned on two separate, consecutive eras. The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

[[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १९ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
घटनामा सबै दोष युवराज दीपेन्द्रलाई थोपरिए तापनि सो घटनामा छिमेकी राष्ट्र भारतको संलग्नता रहेको ठहर नेपालीहरूले गरेका छन्।
राजा बीरेन्द्र भारतको इच्छा विपरित चीन भ्रमणमा गएकोले सो हत्या गरिएको हुनसक्छ ।
In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

The former, [[Asaka (era)|Åšaka]] era has an epoch corresponding to [[78]] AD, whereas the latter [[Amshuvarma|Aṃshuvarmā]] or [[Manadeva 2|Mānadeva 2]] era reckons from [[576]].

Whilst most such inscriptions list the dates र commissioners of [[stonework]] construction, some communicate royal edicts, religious mantras or historical notes. It is through the corroboration of local myths with such evidence that a people prior to the Licchavi have been identified, known as the [[Kirata]]. Of these people very little is known.

The [[Licchavi]] rulers arranged for the documentation of information on politics, society, र the economy in the region. Most of the Licchavi records—written in [[Sanskrit]]—are deeds reporting donations to religious foundations, predominantly Hindu temples; र the last such record was added in [[733]]. [[Image:Nepal map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Nepal]]The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late [[8th century|eighth century]] र was followed by a [[Newari]] era, from [[879]], although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late [[11th century]], southern Nepal came under the influence of the [[Chalukya|Chalukaya Empire]] of [[South India|southern India]]. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.

By the early [[twelfth century|12th century]], leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix "malla" ("wrestler"). [[Arimalla]] was the first king of this dynasty, which was initially marked by upheaval before the kings consolidated their power over the next 200 years.

[[Image:Patan temples.jpg|thumb|250px|Hindu temples in Patan, the capital one of the three medieval kingdoms]]
[[Thirteenth century|Thirteenth-century]] Nepal was occasionally pillaged by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[northern India]], र was marked by increased militarisation. By the late [[14th century]] much of the country came under the rule of the king [[Jayasthitimalla]], who managed to unite most of the fragmented power bases. This unity was short-lived: in [[1482]] the kingdom was carved into three: [[काठमाडौं]], [[Patan]], र [[Bhadgaon]]. 

Modern [[नेपाल|Nepal]] was created in the latter half of the [[18th century]] when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], the ruler of the small [[principality]] of [[Gorkha]], formed a unified country from a number of independent hill states. The country was frequently called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]]. It is a misconception that the Gurkhas took their name from the Gorkha region of Nepal. The region was given its name after the Gurkhas had established their control of these areas. Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the legendary eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. Gurkhas claim descent from the Hindu Rajputs र Brahmins of Northern India, who entered modern Nepal from the west.

After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] dedicated himself at an early age to the conquest of the काठमाडौं valley र the creation of a single state, which he achieved in [[1768]]. Between 1717 र 1733, the Nepalese in the west र Bhutanese in the east attacked [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] many times, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese. The Sikkim king fled to [[Tibet]]. After Shah's death, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into India. Between 1788 र 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet र robbed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Alarmed, the Chinese emperor [[Qianlong]] dispatched a sizeable army that forced the Nepalese to retreat र pay heavy repatriations. 

After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed.
Rivalry between Nepal र the [[British East India Company]] over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] ([[1814]]–[[1816|16]]), in which Nepal suffered a complete rout. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding parts of the Terrai र [[सिक्किम|Sikkim]] to the British in exchange नेपालको लागिese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]].

[[Image:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by उनको Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]

Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime.

In [[1846]], Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to उनको power. The plot was uncovered र the queen had several hundred princes र chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel र administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious र founded the [[Rana]] lineage. The king was made a titular figure, र the post of Prime मन्त्री was made powerful र hereditary. The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development.

The Ranas were staunchly pro-British, र assisted the British during the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] in [[1857]], र later in both [[World War]]s.

In [[1923]] Britain र Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal's independence was recognised by the British.

In the late [[1940s]]. Meanwhile, with the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in [[1950]], India faced the prospect of an expansive military power operating under a radically different political philosophy on its long northern borders, र was thus keen to avoid instability नेपालमा. Forced to act, India sponsored both King [[Tribhuvan]] as Nepal's new ruler in [[1951]], र a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress Party]]. After years of power wrangling between Tribhuvan's son, King [[Mahendra]] र the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in [[1960]]. In [[1962]] he declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal. 

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had been taught in various Indian school र colleges, र from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the Ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle र wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic occupation. The political parties like "The Prajaparishad" र "The Nepali Rastriya Congress" were already formed in exile by the patriotic minded people who wanted to stage both the military र popular political movement नेपालमा to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause executed at the hands of the Ranas were "Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha र Dasharath Chand". This culminated in [[1950]], King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fled उनका "palace prison" to newly independent [[भारत|India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This allowed the return of the Shah family to power and, eventually, the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasiconstitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution नेपालको लागि that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early [[1959]], King [[Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, र the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. [[Koirala]], formed a सरकार र served as prime minister.

Declaring parliamentary democracy a failure 18 months later, King Mahendra dismissed the Koirala सरकार र promulgated a new constitution on [[December 16]], [[1962]]. The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of सरकार closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system enshrined the absolute power of the monarchy र kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) र the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy र all other langauages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which is the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by उनका 27 year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in [[1972]]. Amid student demonstrations र anti-regime activities in [[1979]], King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government—either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, र the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. 

People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. [[Jana Andolan]] forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms र to establish a multiparty parliament. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats र formed the first सरकार in 32 years. In May [[1991]], Nepal held its first election in nearly 50 years. 

In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis र chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[नेपाली काँग्रेस|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups. A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for [[April 6]].

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, र violent erupted वाहिर [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on [[April 6]], clashes between strike activists र police वाहिर a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan]]) left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[काठमाडौं]] was attacked by police forces. As a result riots broke out, र the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The [[Human Rights Organisation of Nepal]] estimated that 14 people, including several on-lookers, had been killed in police firing.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform, र to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in "Operation Romeo" र "Operation Kilo Sera II" which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalized.

 In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which has led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] र [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (also known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts नेपालमा: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha]], र [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations. At one point, 70% of Nepal's countryside was under Maoist rule.

जून २००१ अर्थात् १९ जेठ २०५८ राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। 
तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो। 
In June 2001 Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] went on a shooting-spree assassinating 11 members of the royal family including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] र Queen [[Queen Aiswarya|Aishwarya]] before shooting himself. Due to उनका survival he temporarily became king before dying of उनका wounds resulting in Prince [[Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inheriting the throne. Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, र in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the सरकार र took complete control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country is still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the सरकार र worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son र heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

In the face of unstable governments र a Maoist siege on the काठमाडौं Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On [[2005-02-01]], Gyanendra dismissed the entire सरकार र assumed full executive powers, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone र internet lines were cut, र freedom of the press was severely curtailed. The king's new regime made little progress in उनका stated aim to suppress the insurgents.

King Gyanendra took control once again on February 1, 2005. Municipal elections in February 2006 were described by the European Union as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties boycotted the election र some candidates were forced to run for office by the army. In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement नेपालमा|strikes र street protests in काठमाडौं]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the सरकार र stripped the king of most of उनका powers. At present, the future of monarchy remains in question, र it is unclear whether the Maoist parties, which part of the interim government, will hold true to their cease fire. As of [[15 January]] [[सन् २००७|2007]] Nepal is governed by an [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution.

एशियाका ठूला देशहरू चीन र भारतको बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपटि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो। 

"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग २५०० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एशिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक जङ्गबहादुर राणालाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले कोतपर्व घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू चीन र भारतको बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ।यसमा भगवान बुद्धको समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । महाभारत वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहावाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ ।
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग २५०० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।


इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक जङ्गबहादुर राणालाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले कोतपर्व घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग २५०० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।


इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक जङ्गबहादुर राणालाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले कोतपर्व घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू चीन र भारतको बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । महाभारत वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग २५०० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक जङ्गबहादुर राणालाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले कोतपर्व घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू चीन र भारतको बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । महाभारत वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग २५०० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक जङ्गबहादुर राणालाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले कोतपर्व घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग २५०० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक जङ्गबहादुर राणालाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले कोतपर्व घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू चीन र भारतको बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । महाभारत वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग २५०० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानून सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक जङ्गबहादुर राणालाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले कोतपर्व घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू चीन र भारतको बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । महाभारत वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग २५०० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानून सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानून सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्र, रानी ऐश्वर्य, युवराज दीपेन्द्र (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक जङ्गबहादुर राणालाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले कोतपर्व घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्धमा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक जङ्गबहादुर राणालाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले कोतपर्व घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बंगालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानून सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडी यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानून सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा यलम्बरलाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । अंशुवर्मापछि नरेन्द्रदेवलाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । नान्यदेव चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत डोय राज्यको स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति हरि सिंहदेव सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले जयस्थिति मल्ललाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारका धेरैजनाको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। तत्कालिन युवराज दीपेन्द्रले गरेको भनिएको सो हत्याकाण्डमा [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । (अाजकाे नेपाल हिमालय नेपालहाे र त्यै हिमालयका काख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएका हाम्रा अाँखामाजिवितैरहनेछन् -बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-

"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो ।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथी विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहाे,यसकाेकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकाेछ,जुन दृश्यअाजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथी विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[किर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहाे,यसकाेकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकाेछ,जुन दृश्यअाजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[जनबादी गणतन्त्र चीन|चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवी वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौं उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौं]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहाे,यसकाेकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकाेछ,जुन दृश्यअाजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौं]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौं]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहाे,यसकाेकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकाेछ,जुन दृश्यअाजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौं उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौं, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौं उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौं राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौं उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:नेपालको इतिहास]]
[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जस्को अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछी अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय" बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहाे,यसकाेकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकाेछ,जुन दृश्यअाजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाई सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहाे,यसकाेकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकाेछ,जुन दृश्यअाजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहाे,यसकाेकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकाेछ,जुन दृश्यअाजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौंथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:नेपालको इतिहास]]
[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक सुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहाे,यसकाेकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकाेछ,जुन दृश्यअाजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:नेपालको इतिहास]]
[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहाे,यसकाेकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकाेछ,जुन दृश्यअाजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

[[File:Jung bahadur 1877.jpg|thumb|right|250px|प्रधानमन्त्री जंगबहादुर राणा]]

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहो,यसकोकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकोछ,जुन दृश्यआजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाईमा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहो,यसकोकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकोछ,जुन दृश्यआजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:नेपालको इतिहास]]
[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[गोर्खाली|गोर्खा]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहो,यसकोकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकोछ,जुन दृश्यआजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[नुवाकोट]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[नुवाकोट]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाइ-भतिजामा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको जनमत सँग्रहमा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहो,यसकोकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकोछ,जुन दृश्यआजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 
"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि वंश|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[नुवाकोट]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाइ-भतिजामा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको [[जनमत संग्रह]]मा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहो,यसकोकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकोछ,जुन दृश्यआजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जंगबहादुर राणा|जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि काल|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[नुवाकोट जिल्ला|नुवाकोट]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाइ-भतिजामा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको [[जनमत सङ्ग्रह|जनमत संग्रह]]मा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहो,यसकोकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकोछ,जुन दृश्यआजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।

[[श्रेणी:इतिहास]]
एसियाका ठूला देशहरू [[चीन]] र [[भारत]]को बीचमा हिमालयको काखमा बसेको नेपालको इतिहास यस क्षेत्रका अन्य देशहरूको भन्दा फरक छ। नेपालदेखि दक्षिणपट्टि रहेका देशहरू विदेशी अधिनमा रहँदा पनि नेपाल स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रको रूपमा रहिरह्यो । विभिन्न धर्मशास्त्र तथा पुराणहरूमा नेपाललाई अत्यन्तै प्राचीन भूमिको रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । करीब १३ करोड वर्ष अगाडि बनेका यहाँका पर्वत शृङ्खलाहरू र उपत्यकाहरूमा पछि आएर प्राणीहरूको आकर्षण विशेष रूपमा बढ्दै गएको पाइन्छ । पश्चिम नेपालको [[बुटवल उपमहानगरपालिका|बुटवल]]क्षेत्रमा पाइएको रामापिथेकस मानवको अवशेषले एक करोड वर्षभन्दा अगाडिदेखि नै नेपालमा मानवको बसोबास शुरू भइसकेको तथ्य स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाल नामको पहिलो उल्लेख अथर्वपरिशिष्टमा गरिएको पाइन्छ । अथर्वपरिशिष्टको समय निश्चित गर्न नसकिए तापनि इसापूर्व ५००–६०० को बीचमा यसको निर्माण भएको मानिन्छ । यसमा नेपाललाई कामरू, विदेह उदुम्बर, अवन्ती र कैकय देशहरूसँगै राखी चर्चा गरिएको छ । मूल सर्वास्तिवाद, विनयवस्तु नामको बौद्ध ग्रन्थमा पनि नेपालबारे चर्चा गरिएको छ । यसमा [[गौतम बुद्ध|भगवान बुद्ध]]को समयमै उनका चेलाहरू व्यापारीहरूका साथ नेपाल पसेको घटना उल्लेख गरिएको छ । [[महाभारत]] वनपर्वमा नेपाललाई विषय (देश) को रूपमा वर्णन गरिएको छ । जैन ग्रन्थ आवश्यक सूत्र तथा कौटल्यको अर्थशास्त्र (ई.पू. चौथो शताब्दी) ले पनि नेपालको बारेमा उल्लेख गरेका छन्।त्यस्तै भारतीय [[गुप्त राजवंश|गुप्त सम्राट]] समुद्रगुप्तले आफ्नो [[इलाहाबाद]] अभिलेखमा [[आसाम]] र किर्तिपुर ([[कुमाउँ]]) नेपालको उल्लेख छिमेकी राज्य को रूपमा गरेका छन् भने त्यसपछिका प्रायः सबै स्श्रोतहरूले नेपालको उल्लेख स्वतन्त्र राज्यको रूपमा नै गरेका छन् । नेपालका शिलालेखहरूमा भने वि.सं. ५२२ पछि पाइएका अभिलेखमा नेपाल शब्दको उल्लेख भएको छ । यसरी यो मुलुक अत्यन्तै प्राचीन समयदेखि नै नेपाल नामबाट परिचित रहेको स्पष्ट हुन्छ । नेपाललाई [[सत्य युग]]मा सत्यवती, [[त्रेता युग]]मा तपोवन र [[द्वापर युग]]मा मुक्तिसोपान भनिन्थ्यो र [[कलियुग|कलि युग]]मा नेपाल भन्ने गरिएको कुरा हाम्रा पौराणिक ग्रन्थहरूमा उल्लेख छ । 

"[[नेपाल]]" शब्द सबैभन्दा पहिला अथर्ववेदमा उल्लेख गरिएको पाइन्छ। यसअनुसार नेपाल हिमालको काखमा भएको कारणबाट नेपाल नामको उत्पत्ति [[संस्कृत]] शब्द 'निपालय"बाट भएको हुन सक्छ, जसको अर्थ "पहाडको आधार (खुट्टा) " अथवा "खुट्टामा निवास" हो । 
यसका साथै तलका कथनहरू पनि सुन्नमा आउने गर्दछन्:

[[काठमाडौँ]] उपत्यकामा पाइएका नि‍योलि‍थि‍क उपकरणहरूबाट यो थाहा पाइन्‍छ कि‍ नेपालमा मानि‍सको बसोबास कम्‍ति‍मा पनि‍ ९ हजार वर्ष पहि‍लादेखि‍ हुँदै आएको छ| यसले देखाएको छ कि मानिसहरू जुन शायद [[किराँत जाति|किराँत]] जातिका थिए लगभग १००० वर्ष अगाडि यहाँ बसोबास गर्दथे। किराँती जंगली र पहाडीहरूको एक जनजाति हो, जुन मध्य एसिया, भारत र हिमालयबाट आएर बस्न थाले। किराँत कालभन्दा अगाडि पनि यो मुलुकमा गोपाल, महिषपाल जस्ता अन्य जातिहरूको राज्य थियो भन्ने अपुष्ट इतिहासहरू पनि पाइन्छ तर प्रष्ट प्रमाणको अभावमा किराँत काल सुरु हुनुभन्दा अगाडिको समयलाई प्रामाणिक इतिहासको रूपमा लिइँदैन। यसर्थ आजसम्म नेपालको प्रामाणिक प्राचीन इतिहासको सुरुवात किराँत कालबाटै सुरु भएको हो भन्ने कुराको ऐतिहासिक मान्यता स्थापित भइसकेका छन्। यस कालका राजा [[यलम्बर]]लाई नै प्रथम किराँती राजाको रूपमा मानिन्छ।

सन ४०० देखि ७५० सम्म नेपालको हालको राजधानी [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[लिच्छवि काल|लिच्छवी]]हरूले शासन गर्दथे। कौटिल्यको अर्थशास्त्र अनुसार तथा चिनियाँ यात्री हुएन साङ्गको यात्रा वृत्तान्त अनुसार वैशालीबाट भागेर आएका केही वीर पुरुषले किराँतहरूलाई खेदेर लिच्छवी वंशको स्थापना गरे । पाइएका शिलालेख, मुद्रा र चाँगुनारायण मन्दिरका अभिलेखहरूबाट मानदेव लिच्छवी वंशका प्रथम ऐतिहासिक राजा थिए । अंशुवर्माको भारतका राजा हर्षवर्धनसँग निकटतम वैवाहिक सम्बन्ध थियो । यस तथ्यबाट यो पुष्टि हुन्छ कि गण्डकीदेखि कोशीसम्म पहाडी भूभागमा लिच्छवीहरूले किराँतहरूलाई धपाई एकछत्र राज्य गरेका थिए भने तराई प्रदेशमा प्रसेनजीतर अजातशत्रुका सन्तानहरू मिथिला राज्यलाई आफ्नो अन्तर्गत वैशाली र पाटलीपुत्र राज्यमा समावेश गरेका थिए । [[अंशुवर्मा]]पछि [[नरेन्द्रदेव]]लाई भारतीय रजौटाहरूले समर्थन सहयोग गरी राज्यारुढ गरेका थिए । नरेन्द्रपछि गुप्त वंशका शासनले गर्दा सम्पूर्ण राज्य स-साना राज्य रजौटामा विभाजित भयो । यी सम्पूर्ण घटना ईसा पूर्वका हुन् । उता बङ्गालमा चालुक्यसेनहरूको राज्य थियो । [[नान्यदेव]] चालुक्य राजाको सेनापति थिए । जसले तिरहुत [[डोय राज्य]]को स्थापना गरी सिम्रोनगढलाई राजधानी बनाए । मुसलमान आक्रामक शुद्धिन तुगलकका भयले नान्यदेवका पनाति [[हरिसिंहदेव|हरि सिंहदेव]] सर्लाही जिल्ला हुँदै भक्तपुर पुगे र यिनकी श्रीमती राजल देवीले [[जयस्थिति मल्ल]]लाई ज्वाइँ बनाई मल्लवंशको शासन स्थापित गराइन् ।

विसं १७९९ मा गोर्खाका राजा नरभुपाल शाहको निधन पश्चात राज्य सम्हालेका उनका जेठा छोरा [[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]को राज्य विस्तारको सोच सँगै नेपालको एकिकरणको सुरुवात भयो। उनले प्रथम पटक नुवाकोटमा विसं १८०० मा आक्रमण गरे तर त्यस पटक उनी पराजित भए। फेरी विसं १८०१ म दोस्रो पटक आक्रमण गरी उनले नुवाकोटमाथि विजय प्राप्त गरे। त्यसपछि उनले विसं १८१४ र विसं १८२१ मा [[कीर्तिपुरको युद्ध]]मा दुबै पटक नराम्रो हार ब्यहोर्नु पर्यो। यस युद्धमा किर्तिपुरेहरूले सेनापति कालु पाण्डेलाई मारिदिए र पृथ्वी नारायण शाह भाइ सुरप्रतापको आँखा समेत फोडिदिए। विसं १८२२ चैत्र ३ गते पुन: किर्तिपुरमाथी आक्रमण गरी विजय हासिल गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणले विसं १८२५ भाद्र शुक्ल चर्दुशीमा [[काठमाडौँ]]मा [[इन्द्रजात्रा]] मनाइरहेको दिन पारेर आक्रमण गरेर जित हासिल गरे। यसपछि उनले क्रमश: विसं १८२५ आश्विन २२ मा [[ललितपुर जिल्ला|ललितपुर]], विसं १८२६ कार्तिकमा [[भक्तपुर नगरपालिका|भक्तपुर]]माथि विजय प्राप्त गरे।

[[पृथ्वीनारायण शाह|पृथ्वी नारायण शाह]]ले [[काठमाडौँ उपत्यका]]मा विजय हासिल गरिसकेपछि विसं १८२६ मा आफ्नो देशको राजधानी [[नुवाकोट जिल्ला|नुवाकोट]]बाट [[काठमाडौँ]]मा सार्नुसँगै नयाँ नेपाल अधिराज्यको पनि स्थापना गरे। पृथ्वी नारायणको मृत्यूपछि पनि शाहवंशको राज्य विस्तार अभियान रोकिएन।>राज्य विस्तार पछि अनेकन सन्धीहरु भए पश्चात १९२३ ई २१ डिसेम्वर का दिन

राणाहरूले गरेको पारिवारिक शासन। नेपालमा यो विक्रम सम्बत १९०३ देखि प्रारम्भ भएर २००७ साल सम्म कायम रह्यो। यसमा राणा प्रधानमन्त्रीका भाइ-भतिजामा पद सर्दै जाने नियम थियो। देशका मुख्य मुख्य शक्तिशाली पदहरूमा पनि राणा खानदानका नै मानिसहरू नियुक्त हुन्थे। आधारभूत मौलिक अधिकार हुँदैनथ्यो। राणाले जे बोले पनि कानुन सरह लागू हुन्थ्यो।

विसं २०४६ मा भएको नेपालको प्रथम जनआन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक दलहरू एकै उद्देश्य लिएर सडकमा उत्रिएका थिए। नेपाली कांग्रेसले नेतृत्त्व गरेको यो आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीहरूको समूह संयुक्त वाम मोर्चा बनाएर आन्दोलनमा उत्रियो। ५० दिनसम्म चलेको यो आन्दोलनमा तत्कालीन पञ्चायती शासकहरूले बर्बरतापूर्वक दमन गरे।२०१७ सालमा राजा महेन्द्रले जन निर्वाचित तत्कालिन प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई पदच्यूत गर्दै संसद समेत भङ्ग गरेर निर्दलीय पञ्चायती व्यवस्था कायम गरे। तर १८ सालको क्रान्ति, ३३ सालको बीपीको मेलमिलाप नीति, २०३६ सालको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन आदिको दवावका कारण २०३६मा तत्कालीन राजा बीरेन्द्रले नेपालमा जनमत सँग्रह गराए। बहुदल वा सुधारिएको पञ्चायत कुन रोज्ने भनी गराइएको [[जनमत सङ्ग्रह|जनमत संग्रह]]मा राज्य शक्तिको चरम दुरूपयोग गरी पञ्चायत पक्षलाई जिताइयो। त्यसपछि पनि देशमा बहुदलीय व्यवस्था स्थापना हुन नसकेपछि २०४२ सालमा नेपाली कांग्रेसले सत्याग्रह सुरू गर्यो। अन्तत यो कदम २०४६ मा जनआन्दोलनमा परिणत भयो।

विसं २०५८ जेठ १९ गते राती नारायणहिटी दरवारभित्र भएको रक्तपातपूर्ण गोलीकाण्डमा राजा बीरेन्द्रको परिवारका सबैजनाको हत्या भयो। [[वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|राजा बीरेन्द्र]], [[रानी ऐश्वर्य राज्यलक्ष्मी शाह|रानी ऐश्वर्य]], [[दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह|युवराज दीपेन्द्र]] (एक दिन पछि मृत्यु भएको भनिएको), राजकुमारी श्रुती, राजकुमार निराजन लगायत राजपरिवारको मृत्यु भएको थियो।

दोस्रो जनआन्दोलन नेपालमा भएको शान्तिपूर्ण आन्दोलन थियो जुन १९ दिनसम्म चलेको थियो। यस आन्दोलनले नेपालको २ सय ३७ वर्ष पुरानो राजतन्त्र ढालेर देशमा लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्रको जग बसाल्यो। यस आन्दोलनमा विभिन्न राजनीतिक पार्टी र शसस्त्र युद्ध गरिरहेको माओवादी समेत सम्मिलित भएको थियो।

इतिहास(नेपाल हिमालयहो,यसकोकाख समुन्द्रीसतहसम्म फैलिएकोछ,जुन दृश्यआजपनी सजिवछ र सजिवरहनेनैछ-बिष्णुहरिलामिछाने-)

हिमालय क्षेत्रमा मानिसहरू बस्न थालेको कम्तिमा पनि ९,००० वर्ष भएको कुरा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकामा पाइएका प्राचीन औजारहरूबाट पुष्टि हुन्छ। सम्भवत: भोट-बर्मेली मूलका मानिसहरू नेपालमा २,५०० वर्ष अगाडि बसोबास गर्दथे।[४]

ईशापूर्व १५०० तिर इन्डो-आर्यन जातिहरू उपत्यका प्रवेश गरे। ईशापूर्वको १००० तिर स-साना राज्यहरू र राज्यसङ्गठनहरू बने। सिद्धार्थ गौतम (ईशापूर्व ५६३–४८३) त्यस्तै एक वंश, शाक्यवंशका राजकुमार थिए, जसले आफ्नो राजकाज त्यागी तपस्वीको जीवन अँगाले र उनी बुद्ध भनेर विश्व प्रसिद्ध भए।

ईशापूर्वको २५० सम्ममा, यो क्षेत्र उत्तर भारतको मौर्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा पर्‍यो र पछि चौँथो शताब्दिमा गुप्त साम्राज्यको अधीनस्थ राज्य हुनपुग्यो। यो क्षेत्रमा ५औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा आएर लिच्छवीहरूले राज्य गरे। ८औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा लिच्छवीवंश अस्त हुनथाल्यो र सन् ८७९ देखि नेवार युगको उदय भयो, तथापि उनीहरूको नियन्त्रणमा देशको कति विस्तार भएको थियो यकिन छैन। ११औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्द्धमा दक्षिण भारतबाट आएका चालुक्य साम्राज्यको प्रभावमा नेपालको दक्षिणी भूभाग पर्‍यो। चालुक्यहरूको प्रभावमा त्यति बेला चलिआएको बुद्ध धर्मको साटो राजाहरूले हिन्दू धर्मको समर्थन गर्न थाले र नेपालमा हिन्दू धर्म तर्फको धार्मिक परिवर्तन हुनथाल्यो।

१३औं शताब्दिको पूर्वार्द्धमा संस्कृत शब्द मल्ल थर भएका नाइकेहरूको उदय हुनथाल्यो। सुरूमा उनीहरूको सत्ता उदयमान भयो, तर त्यसपछिका २०० वर्षहरूमा राजाहरूले उनीहरूको शक्ति एकमुष्ट पार्ने मात्र काम गरे। १४औं शताब्दिको उत्तरार्धमा देशका धेरैजसो भागहरू एकीकृत राज्यको अधीनमा आए। तर यो एकीकरण छोटो समयसम्म मात्र टिक्यो: १४८२मा यक्ष मल्लको समयमा आफ्ना छोराहरूलाई अंशबण्डामा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका तीन राज्य बाँडेर दिने निर्णय पछि यो राज्य तीन भागमा टुक्रियो - काठमाडौँ, पाटन, र भादगाउँ – जसको बीचमा शताब्दियौंसम्म खिचातानी र दुश्मनी रहिरहेको थियो।

१७६५ मा, गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीनारायण शाहले थोरैमात्र हतियार र सहयोग जुटाई छिमेकी राज्यहरू, (खासगरी लम्जुङ्ग, कास्की र तनहूँ)को तटस्थता आफ्नो पक्षमा उपयोग गर्न सफल भएपछि देश एकीकरणका निम्ति अघि बढे। धेरै रक्तरञ्जित लडाईंहरू पश्चात्, उनी ३ वर्षपछि काठमाडौँ उपत्यकालाई विशाल नेपाल भित्र एकीकरण गर्ने अभियानमा सफलता प्राप्त गरे।तथापि उनले तत्कालीन राजा जयप्रकाश मल्लले राज्य गरिरहेको काठमाडौँ राज्यलाई जित्दाखेरि कुनै युद्ध गर्नु परेन। वास्तवमा, त्यतिबेला इन्द्रजात्रा पर्वमा काठमाडौँ उपत्यकाका सबै जनताहरू जात्रा मनाइरहेका थिए जब पृथ्वी नारायण शाहले आफ्ना सेनाहरू लिएर खासै कुनै मेहनतबिना उपत्यकालाई कब्जा गरे आफै बसेर जात्रा चलाएर साँस्कृतिक सम्मानको अवधारणा प्रस्तुत गरे। त्यसैगरी नेपाल एकीकरणको सिलसिलामा सम्पूर्ण साना राज्यहरू जितेपछि पूर्वमा पल्लो किरात लिम्बूवान राज्य पुगे लिम्बूवान राज्यमा १७ पटक सम्म हमला गरी वि.स‌ं २२/०४/१८३१ मा लिम्बूवानको केन्द्रीय राजधानी विजयपुरमा लालमोहर सहित तम्रपत्रमा लेखी सन्धि भयो। यसले नयाँ नेपालको जन्मको आधारशिला तय गर्‍यो।

तिब्बतसँग हिमाली मार्गको नियन्त्रणको निम्ति भएको [[नेपाल –तिब्बत /चीन युद्ध|विवाद र त्यस पश्चातको युद्ध]]मा चीन तिब्बतको सहायताको लागि आएपछि नेपाल पछि हट्नुपर्‍यो। नेपालको सीमा नजीकका स-साना राज्यहरूलाई हडपेका कारण सुरू भएको ब्रिटिस इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनी सँगको दुश्मनीका कारण रक्तरञ्जित [[नेपाल अङ्ग्रेज युद्ध|एङ्गलो-नेपाल युद्ध]] (१८१४–१६) भयो, जसमा नेपालले हालको सीमा रक्षा गर्न सफल भएपनि महाकाली नदी पश्चिमको आफ्ना क्षेत्रहरू गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। ती क्षेत्रहरू हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य र हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू पर्दछन। आफ्नो स्वाधीनताका लागि नेपालले इस्ट इण्डिया कम्पनिसँग सुगौली सन्धि गरेर तराईका केही भूभाग र एक तिहाइभन्दा बढी भूभाग सहित सिक्किम ,दार्जिलिनङ्ग गुमाउनु पर्‍यो। कांगडासम्म पुगेका नेपाली र सतलजदेखि टिस्टासम्मको विशाल नेपाल मेची र कालीमा सीमित हुन पुग्यो, तर पनि पछि १८६०मा प्रथम राणा प्रधानमन्त्री जङ्गबहादुर राणासँग खुसी भई अङ्ग्रेजले नेपाललाई राप्तीदेखि कालीसम्मको तराई फर्काइदिएका थिए।

राज परिवार बीचको गुटबन्दीका कारण युद्धपछि अस्थायित्व कायम भयो। सन् १८४६मा शासन गरिरहेकी रानीको सेनानायक [[जङ्गबहादुर राणा]]लाई पदच्युत गर्ने षड्यन्त्रको खुलासा हुनाले [[कोत पर्व|कोतपर्व]] घट्न पुग्यो। हतियारधारी सेना र रानीप्रति बफादार भाइ-भारदारहरूबीच मार-काट चल्नाले देशका सयौं राजखलक, भारदारहरू र रजौटाहरूको हत्या भयो। जङ्गबहादुरले जितेपछि राणा खानदान सुरू गरे र राणा शासन लागू गरे। राजालाई नाममात्रमा सीमित गरियो र प्रधानमन्त्री पदलाई शक्तिशाली र वंशाणुगत गरियो। राणाहरू पूर्णनिष्ठाले ब्रिटिसहरूका पक्षमा थिए र ब्रिटिसहरूलाई १८५७को सिपोई रिबेलियन (प्रथम भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता संग्राम), र पछि दुबै विश्व युद्धहरूमा सघाएका थिए। सन् १९२३मा संयुक्त अधिराज्य र नेपालबिच आधिकारिक रूपमा मित्रताको सम्झौतामा हस्ताक्षर भयो, जसमा नेपालको स्वतन्त्रतालाई संयुक्त अधिराज्यले स्विकार्‍यो।
