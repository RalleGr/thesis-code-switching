संयुक्त अधिराज्य

ग्रेट ब्रिटेन र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (अङ्ग्रेजीमा - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, छोटकरिमा UK), समान्यतया छोट्याएर संयुक्त अधिराज्य भनेको उत्तरपूर्वी युरोपको एक देश हो। यो देश चारवटा अलग देशहरू मिलेर बनेको देश हो। यी देशहरू हुन् - ग्रेट ब्रिटेन टापुका बेलायत, स्कटल्याण्ड, र वेल्स अनि आयरल्याण्ड टापुको उत्तरी आयरल्याण्ड।

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन्। अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ। यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्स, कोर्नवालमा कर्निस, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कट्टिस र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आयरिस।

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको राजधानी लण्डन हो, जुन बेलायतको दक्षिणपूर्व स्थित थेम्स नदीको किनारमा रहेको एक विशाल सहर हो। अन्य ठूला सहरहरू बर्मिङघम, ब्रिस्टल, म्यानचेस्टर, लिभरपुल, योर्क, न्युक्यसल अपन टाइन, लिड्स, सेफ्फिल्ड, कार्डिफ, एडिनब्रा, ग्लासगो, इन्भेर्नेस, आबेरडिन, डुनी, बेलफास्ट, र लण्डनडेर्री (जसलाई डेर्री पनि भनिन्छ) हुन्। 

संयुक्त अधिराज्य युरोपको मुख्यभुमीको उत्तरपश्चिम किनारमा अवस्थित छ। संयुक्त अधिराज्यको वरिपरि उत्तर समुद्र, अङ्ग्रेज च्यानल र एटलान्टिक महासागर छन्।

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको अधिनमा केही स-साना ठाउँहरूपनि छन्, जसलाई "समुद्रपारका प्रान्तहरू" भनिन्छ। 

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them and to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK and is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime Minister is Tony Blair, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons and the House of Lords and the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime Minister since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign and it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, her closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England and Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish and English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain and Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them and to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK and is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime Minister is Tony Blair, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons and the House of Lords and the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime Minister since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign and it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, her closest relative was James the King of Scotland.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament.

The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको राजधानी लण्डन हो, जुन बेलायतको दक्षिणपूर्व स्थित टेम्ज नदीको किनारमा रहेको एक विशाल सहर हो। अन्य ठूला सहरहरू बर्मिङहम, ब्रिस्टल, म्यानचेस्टर, लिभरपुल, योर्क, न्युक्यासल अपन टाइन, लिड्स, शेफिल्ड, कार्डिफ, एडिनब्रा, ग्लासगो, इन्भेर्नेस, आबेरडिन, डुनी, बेलफास्ट, र लण्डनडेरी (जसलाई डेरी पनि भनिन्छ) हुन् । 

संयुक्त अधिराज्य युरोपको मुख्यभुमीको उत्तरपश्चिम किनारमा अवस्थित छ । संयुक्त अधिराज्यको वरिपरि उत्तर समुद्र, अङ्ग्रेज च्यानल र एटलान्टिक महासागर छन् ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

महान् बेलायत र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (अङ्ग्रेजीमा - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, छोटकरिमा UK), समान्यतया छोट्याएर संयुक्त अधिराज्य भनेको उत्तरपश्चिम युरोपको एक देश हो। यो देश चारवटा अलग देशहरू मिलेर बनेको देश हो। यी देशहरू हुन् - महान् बेलायत टापुका बेलायत, स्कटल्याण्ड, र वेल्स अनि आयरल्याण्ड टापुको उत्तरी आयरल्याण्ड।

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

महान् बेलायत र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (अङ्ग्रेजीमा - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, छोटकरिमा UK), समान्यतया छोट्याएर संयुक्त अधिराज्य भनेको उत्तरपश्चिम युरोपको एक देश हो। यो देश चारवटा अलग देशहरू मिलेर बनेको देश हो। यी देशहरू हुन् - महान् बेलायत टापुका बेलायत, स्कटल्याण्ड, र वेल्स अनि आयरल्याण्ड टापुको उत्तरी आयरल्याण्ड।

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको राजधानी लण्डन हो, जुन बेलायतको दक्षिणपूर्व स्थित टेम्ज नदीको किनारमा रहेको एक विशाल सहर हो। अन्य ठूला सहरहरू बर्मिङहम, ब्रिस्टल, म्यानचेस्टर, लिभरपुल, योर्क, न्युक्यासल अपन टाइन, लिड्स, शेफिल्ड, कार्डिफ, एडिनब्रा, ग्लासगो, इन्भेर्नेस, आबेरडिन, डुनी, बेलफास्ट, र लण्डनडेरी (जसलाई डेरी पनि भनिन्छ) हुन् । 

संयुक्त अधिराज्य युरोपको मुख्यभुमीको उत्तरपश्चिम किनारमा अवस्थित छ । संयुक्त अधिराज्यको वरिपरि उत्तर समुद्र, अङ्ग्रेज च्यानल र एटलान्टिक महासागर छन् ।

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको अधिनमा केही स-साना ठाउँहरू पनि छन्, जसलाई "समुद्रपारका प्रान्तहरू" भनिन्छ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

महान् बेलायत र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (अङ्ग्रेजीमा - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, छोटकरिमा UK), समान्यतया छोट्याएर संयुक्त अधिराज्य भनेको उत्तरपश्चिम युरोपको एक देश हो। यो देश चारवटा अलग देशहरू मिलेर बनेको देश हो। यी देशहरू हुन् - महान् बेलायत टापुका बेलायत, स्कटल्याण्ड, र वेल्स अनि आयरल्याण्ड टापुको उत्तरी आयरल्याण्ड।

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

महान् बेलायत र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (अङ्ग्रेजीमा - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, छोटकरिमा UK), समान्यतया छोट्याएर संयुक्त अधिराज्य भनेको उत्तरपश्चिम युरोपको एक देश हो। यो देश चारवटा अलग देशहरू मिलेर बनेको देश हो। यी देशहरू हुन् - महान् बेलायत टापुका बेलायत, स्कटल्याण्ड, र वेल्स अनि आयरल्याण्ड टापुको उत्तरी आयरल्याण्ड।

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको राजधानी लण्डन हो, जुन बेलायतको दक्षिणपूर्व स्थित टेम्ज नदीको किनारमा रहेको एक विशाल सहर हो। अन्य ठूला सहरहरू बर्मिङहम, ब्रिस्टल, म्यानचेस्टर, लिभरपुल, योर्क, न्युक्यासल अपन टाइन, लिड्स, शेफिल्ड, कार्डिफ, एडिनब्रा, ग्लासगो, इन्भेर्नेस, आबेरडिन, डुनी, बेलफास्ट, र लण्डनडेरी (जसलाई डेरी पनि भनिन्छ) हुन् । 

संयुक्त अधिराज्य युरोपको मुख्यभुमीको उत्तरपश्चिम किनारमा अवस्थित छ । संयुक्त अधिराज्यको वरिपरि उत्तर समुद्र, अङ्ग्रेज च्यानल र एटलान्टिक महासागर छन् ।

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको अधिनमा केही स-साना ठाउँहरू पनि छन्, जसलाई "समुद्रपारका प्रान्तहरू" भनिन्छ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

महान् बेलायत र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (अङ्ग्रेजीमा - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, छोटकरिमा UK), समान्यतया छोट्याएर संयुक्त अधिराज्य भनेको उत्तरपश्चिम युरोपको एक देश हो। यो देश चारवटा अलग देशहरू मिलेर बनेको देश हो। यी देशहरू हुन् - महान् बेलायत टापुका बेलायत, स्कटल्याण्ड, र वेल्स अनि आयरल्याण्ड टापुको उत्तरी आयरल्याण्ड।

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

महान् बेलायत र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (अङ्ग्रेजीमा - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, छोटकरिमा UK), समान्यतया छोट्याएर संयुक्त अधिराज्य भनेको उत्तरपश्चिम युरोपको एक देश हो। यो देश चारवटा अलग देशहरू मिलेर बनेको देश हो। यी देशहरू हुन् - महान् बेलायत टापुका बेलायत, स्कटल्याण्ड, र वेल्स अनि आयरल्याण्ड टापुको उत्तरी आयरल्याण्ड।

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको राजधानी लण्डन हो, जुन बेलायतको दक्षिणपूर्व स्थित टेम्ज नदीको किनारमा रहेको एक विशाल सहर हो। अन्य ठूला सहरहरू बर्मिङहम, ब्रिस्टल, म्यानचेस्टर, लिभरपुल, योर्क, न्युक्यासल अपन टाइन, लिड्स, शेफिल्ड, कार्डिफ, एडिनब्रा, ग्लासगो, इन्भेर्नेस, आबेरडिन, डुनी, बेलफास्ट, र लण्डनडेरी (जसलाई डेरी पनि भनिन्छ) हुन् । 

संयुक्त अधिराज्य युरोपको मुख्यभुमीको उत्तरपश्चिम किनारमा अवस्थित छ । संयुक्त अधिराज्यको वरिपरि उत्तर समुद्र, अङ्ग्रेज च्यानल र एटलान्टिक महासागर छन् ।

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको अधिनमा केही स-साना ठाउँहरू पनि छन्, जसलाई "समुद्रपारका प्रान्तहरू" भनिन्छ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको राजधानी लण्डन हो, जुन बेलायतको दक्षिणपूर्व स्थित टेम्ज नदीको किनारमा रहेको एक विशाल सहर हो। अन्य ठूला सहरहरू बर्मिङहम, ब्रिस्टल, म्यानचेस्टर, लिभरपुल, योर्क, न्युक्यासल अपन टाइन, लिड्स, शेफिल्ड, कार्डिफ, एडिनब्रा, ग्लासगो, इन्भेर्नेस, आबेरडिन, डुनी, बेलफास्ट, र लण्डनडेरी (जसलाई डेरी पनि भनिन्छ) हुन् । 

संयुक्त अधिराज्य युरोपको मुख्यभुमीको उत्तरपश्चिम किनारमा अवस्थित छ । संयुक्त अधिराज्यको वरिपरि उत्तर समुद्र, अङ्ग्रेज च्यानल र एटलान्टिक महासागर छन् ।

संयुक्त अधिराज्यको अधिनमा केही स-साना ठाउँहरू पनि छन्, जसलाई "समुद्रपारका प्रान्तहरू" भनिन्छ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

महान् बेलायत र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (अङ्ग्रेजीमा - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, छोटकरिमा UK), समान्यतया छोट्याएर संयुक्त अधिराज्य भनेको उत्तरपश्चिम युरोपको एक देश हो। यो देश चारवटा अलग देशहरू मिलेर बनेको देश हो। यी देशहरू हुन् - विशाल बेलायत टापुका बेलायत, स्कटल्याण्ड, र वेल्स अनि आयरल्याण्ड टापुको उत्तरी आयरल्याण्ड।

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain".

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

महान् बेलायत र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (अङ्ग्रेजीमा - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, छोटकरिमा UK), समान्यतया छोट्याएर संयुक्त अधिराज्य भनेको उत्तरपश्चिम युरोपको एक देश हो। यो देश चारवटा अलग देशहरू मिलेर बनेको देश हो। यी देशहरू हुन् - विशाल बेलायत टापुका बेलायत, स्कटल्याण्ड, र वेल्स अनि आयरल्याण्ड टापुको उत्तरी आयरल्याण्ड।

करिव ६ करोड जनसङ्ख्या यस देशमा बसोबास गर्दछन् । अङ्ग्रेजी सबैभन्दा बढी बोलिने भाषा हो, तर अन्य धेरै भाषाहरू पनि बोलिन्छ । यस देशमा अङ्ग्रेजी बाहेक अन्य धेरै मात्रीभाषाहरू छन् - वेल्समा वेल्श, कोर्नवालमा कर्निश, स्कटल्यण्डमा स्कटिश र स्कट्स, र उत्तर आयरल्याण्डमा आइरिश ।

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties.

They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them र to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK र is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime मन्त्री is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party.

Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons र the House of Lords र the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime मन्त्री since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords.

Northern Ireland, Scotland र Wales have their own devolved Assemblies, which do less than the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign र it can suspend the devolved administrations at any time. The Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended whilst extensive negotiations are underway to resolve concerns between the two major parties. Usually there is agreement about what types of law are made by each Assembly.

Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. When Queen Elizabeth I of England died, उनको closest relative was James the King of Scotland. He was king of both England र Scotland, but they stayed as two countries. In 1707, the Scottish र English Parliaments passed the Treaty of Union, which joined them as one country called "Great Britain". 

By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain र Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the "United Kingdom of Great Britain र Ireland". In 1922 much of Ireland be came independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed "The United Kingdom of Great Britain र Northern Ireland".

बेलायत र उत्तरी आयरल्याण्डको संयुक्त अधिराज्य (
ग्रेट ब्रिटेन र उत्तरी आयरलैंड का यूनाइटेड किंगडम (सामान्यतः यूनाइटेड किंगडम, यू के, UK , या ब्रिटेन को रूपमा जानिन्छ)। 
एक विकसित देश हो जो महाद्वीपीय यूरोप को पश्चिमोत्तर किनारामा स्थित छ। यो एक द्वीपीय देश हो, यो ब्रिटिश द्वीप समूहमा फैलिएको छ, जसमा ग्रेट ब्रिटेन, आयरलैंड का पूर्वोत्तर भाग, र केही साना द्वीप शामिल छन। उत्तरी आयरलैंड, UK का एकमात्र ऐसा हिस्सा हो जहां एक स्थल सिमाना अन्य राष्ट्र सम्ग जोडिईन्छ, र यहां आयरलैण्ड यू के का छिमेकी देश हो। यो देशको सिमानाको अलावा, UK एटलान्टिक महासागर , उत्तरी सागर, इंग्लिश चैनल र आयरिश सागर बाट घेरिएको छ। सबभन्दा ठुलो द्वीप, ग्रेट ब्रिटेन, चैनल सुरंग द्वारा फ़्रांस संग जोडीएको छ। 

यूनाइटेड किंगडम एक संवैधानिक राजशाही र एकात्मक राज्य हो जसमा चार देश शामिल छ: इंग्लैंड, उत्तरी आयरलैंड, स्कॉटलैंड र वेल्स. यो एक संसदीय प्रणाली द्वारा संचालित छ जसको राजधानी लण्डन मा सरकार बस्छ, तर यस मध्ये तीनमा निक्षेपण गरिएको प्रशासन छ, बेलफ़ास्ट, कार्डिफ़ र एडिनबर्ग, क्रमशः उत्तरी आयरलैंड, वेल्स र स्कॉटलैंड को राजधानी। जर्सी र ग्वेर्नसे द्वीप समूह, जसलाई सामूहिक रूपबाट चैनल द्वीप भनिन्छ, र मैन द्वीप (आईल ऑफ मान), यू के को राजत्व निर्भरता छ र UK को हिस्सा होईन। यसको अलावा, UK को चौध समुद्रपार निर्भर क्षेत्र हो, ब्रिटिश साम्राज्य, जो १९२२ मा आफ्नो चरम थियो, विश्वको लगभग एक चौथाई क्षेत्रफ़ललाई घेरद थियो र इतिहास का सबभन्दा ठुलो साम्राज्य थियो। यसको पूर्व उपनिवेशहरुको भाषा, संस्कृति र कानूनी प्रणालीमा ब्रिटिश प्रभाव अहिले पनि देख्न सकिन्छ। 

प्रतीकत्मक GDP द्वारा विश्वको छैठौं ठुलो अर्थव्यवस्था र क्रय शक्ति समानता को हिसाबबाट सातौं ठुलो देश भएको साथै, UK एक विकसित देश हो। यो विश्वको पहलो औद्योगिक देश थियो र १९ औं र २० औं शताब्दीको दौरान विश्वको अग्रणी शक्ति थियो, तर दुई विश्व युद्धहरुको आर्थिक लागत र २० औं शताब्दीको उत्तरार्धमा साम्राज्यको पतनले विश्व मामिलामा उसको अग्रणी भूमिकालाई कम गर्यो। फेरी पनि UK आफ्नो मजबूत आर्थिक, सांस्कृतिक, सैन्य, वैज्ञानिक र राजनीतिक प्रभावको कारण एक प्रमुख शक्ति कायमै छ। यो एक परमाणु शक्ति हो र विश्वमा चौथो सर्वाधिक रक्षा खर्चा गर्ने वाला देश हो। यो यूरोपीय संघ को सदस्य हो, संयुक्त राष्ट्र सुरक्षा परिषद मा एक स्थायी सीट धारण गर्दछ, र राष्ट्र को राष्ट्रमंडल, G8, OECD, NATO, र विश्व व्यापार संगठन को सदस्य हो।

1 मई 1707 मा, इंग्लैंडको साम्राज्य (जसमा वेल्स शामिल थियो) र स्कॉटलैंडको साम्राज्य को राजनीतिक संघ द्वारा ब्रिहत्तर ब्रिटेनको संयुक्त राजशाही को स्थापना गरियो। यो सन्धिलाई सहमति 22 जुलाई 1706 मा प्राप्त भयो | र फेरी इंग्लैंडको संसद र स्कॉटलैंडको संसद दुबैले एक संघको ऐन 1707 द्वारा यसको पुष्टि गरे। लगभग एक शताब्दी पछी, आयरलैंड का साम्राज्य, जो 1691 सम्म अंग्रेजी नियन्त्रणमा आएको थियो, त्यो यूनाइटेड किंगडम बनाउनको लागी संघको ऐन 1800 द्वारा ग्रेट ब्रिटेन साम्राज्यको साथ विलय भयो। जबकि इंग्लैंड र स्कॉटलैंड 1707 भन्दा पहिले अलग भएको थिए, वे 1603 मा राजत्वको संघ बाट नै व्यक्तिगत रूपबाट संघ मा थे, जब स्कॉट्सको राजा जेम्स VI को इंग्लैंड र आयरलैंड राज्य का सिंहासन विरासतमा मिला र वे आफ्नो दरबार ईडिनबर्ग बाट लण्डन ले गए.

नपोलियन युद्धों मा नेपोलियन को हार पछी, UK १० औं शताब्दीमा नौसेनामा प्रमुख शक्तिको रूपमा उभरा र २० औं शताब्दीको मध्यसम्म एक प्रख्यात शक्ति बना रहा. 1921 सम्म ब्रिटिश साम्राज्य आफ्नो अधिकतम आकारमा विस्तारित भयो, विश्व युद्घ I पछी जर्मन र तुर्क कालोनियों मा राष्टों का संघटन शासनादेश हासिल गर्यो। एक बर्ष पछी, विश्वको पहिलो ठुलो मात्रामा अन्तरराष्ट्रीय प्रसारण नेटवर्क, BBC, बनाईएको थियो।

1918 मा सिन् फेइन को एक चुनावमा जीत हुई, जसको पछी आयरलैंडमा स्वतंत्रता को लड़ाई ले 1921 मा यस द्वीपको विभाजन का नेतृत्व गर्यो यस पछी 1922 मा आयरिश स्वतंत्र राज्य को स्वतंत्रता हुई जब उत्तरी आयरलैंड ले UK का हिस्सा बन्न का चयन गर्यो। यसको परिणामस्वरूप, 1927 मा, UK का औपचारिक नाम उसके वर्तमान नाममा बदल गया थियो, ग्रेट ब्रिटेन र उत्तरी आयरलैंड का यूनाइटेड किंगडम.

तुरंत युद्धोत्तर वर्षले कल्याणकारी राज्य को स्थापना देखी, जसमा विश्वको पहिलो र सबभन्दा व्यापक सार्वजनिक स्वास्थ्य सेवाएँ शामिल थियो, जबकि अर्थव्यवस्थामा सुधारको मांगले एक बहु जातीय ब्रिटेन बनाउनको लागी राष्ट्रमंडल भरीबाट लोगों को अग्रानीत गर्यो।। जबकि 1956 को स्वेज संकट द्वारा ब्रिटेनको राजनीतिक भूमिका को नया युद्धोत्तर सिमाना पुष्टि भयो, अंग्रेजी भाषा को अन्तरराष्ट्रीय फैल का मतलब हो साहित्य र संस्कृति का प्रभाव जारी रहना, जबकि 1960 देखी यसको लोकप्रिय संस्कृति का विदेशमा पनि प्रभाव पाईएको थियो।

1970 मा विश्व आर्थिक मंदी र औद्योगिक विवादको अवधि पछी, 1980 को दशक ले पर्याप्त उत्तरी सागर को तेल आमदनी र आर्थिक विकास का आगमन देखा.मार्गरेट थैचर को प्रधान मन्त्रिपद ले युद्धोत्तर राजनीतिक र आर्थिक सहमतिबाट एक महत्वपूर्ण दिशा परिवर्तन को चिह्नित गर्यो; एक रास्ता जो 1997 पछीबाट टोनी ब्लेयर र गॉर्डन ब्राउन को नई श्रम सरकारों को तहत जारी रहयो।.

1992 मा मास्ट्रिच सन्धि मा हस्ताक्षरबाट यूरोपीय संघ को शुरुआतको 12 संस्थापक देशहरु मध्ये एक यूनाइटेड किंगडम थियो। यसको पूर्व, 1973 बाट यो यूरोपीय संघको यूरोपीय आर्थिक समुदाय (EEC) का एक अग्रदूत सदस्य रहेको छ। वर्तमान मजदूर सरकार का संगठनको साथ एकीकरणको दिशामा दृष्टिकोण मिश्रित छ, सरकारी विपक्षको साथ, रूढ़िवादी पार्टी, जो केही शक्तियों र सक्षमताओं का पक्ष लिन्छ त्यसलाई यूरोपीय संघ को हस्तांतरित गरियो। २० औं शताब्दीको अंत ले पूर्व-विधायी संदर्भ पछी उत्तरी आयरलैंड, स्कॉटलैंड र वेल्सको लागी निक्षेपण गरिएको राष्ट्रीय प्रशासनको स्थापनाको साथ UK को शासनमा केही परिवर्तन देखे.

यूनाइटेड किंगडम एक संवैधानिक राजशाही छ। महारानी एलिजाबेथ II UK तथा पन्ध्र अन्य राष्ट्रमंडल देशों को राज्य प्रमुख हुन UK का यि पन्ध्र देशहरुको साथ एक निजी संघ छ। यसको अलावा आइल ऑफ मैन, जर्सी र ग्वेर्नसे यूके को राजत्व निर्भरता हो र महारानीको यि क्षेत्रहरुमा सार्वभौमत्व छ, जो यूनाइटेड किंगडम को हिस्सा होइन तर UK सरकार यसको विदेशी मामलों र रक्षा शासन गर्दछ र UK संसद को उनको तर्फबाट व्यवस्था गर्ने अधिकार राख्दछ।

चूंकि यूनाइटेड किंगडम वर्तमान विश्वको तीन देशहरु मध्ये एक हो जसमा सुव्यवस्थित संविधान छैन , यूनाइटेड किंगडम का संविधान मा धेरै जसो लिखित स्रोत छन, जसमा संविधियाँ, न्यायाधीश द्वारा बनाए गए कानूनी मामले र अन्तरराष्ट्रीय सन्धिहरु शामिल छ। चूंकि साधारण विधियों र "संवैधानिक व्यवस्था" को बीच कुनै प्रबिधिक अन्तर छैन, UK संसद केवल संसद को अधिनियमों को पारित गरेर "संवैधानिक सुधार" गर्न सक्दछ र उसको साथ लगभग संविधानको कुनै पनि लिखित या अलिखित तत्व को यस प्रकार बदल्ने या समाप्त गर्ने शक्ति छ। फेरी पनि, कुनै पनि संसद कानून पारित नहीं कर सकती जो आगामी सरकार बदल्न सक्दैन.

UK का एक संसदीय सरकार वेस्टमिंस्टर प्रणाली मा आधारित छ जसको विश्व भरीले नकल गरेको छ - ब्रिटिश साम्राज्य को एक विरासत.वेस्टमिंस्टर को महल मा पाईने यूनाइटेड किंगडम को संसद को दुई सदन छ: एक लोक सदन र एक नियुक्त यहोवा सदन, र कुनै पनि विधेयक को कानून बनाउनको लागी शाही स्वीकृति को आवश्यकता हुदछ। यो यूनाइटेड किंगडम का अन्तिम विधायी अधिकार हो किनकी स्कॉटलैंड मा निक्षेपण गरिएको संसद र उत्तरी आयरलैंड र वेल्स को निक्षेपण गरिएको सभा प्रधान निकाय होईन र यो संदर्बित हो की स्थापित हुने बावजूद सार्वजनिक स्वीकृति पछी UK को संसद द्वारा समाप्त गर्न सकिन्छ।प्रधानमन्त्री को पद, जो UK को सरकारको शासक हो, संसद सदस्य हुन जो लोक सदनको बहुमत का विश्वास प्राप्त गर्न सक्दछन , सामान्यतया सदनको सबभन्दा ठुलो राजनीतिक पार्टीको मौजूदा नेता। महारानी साहिबाको सरकार बनाउन लागी राजा द्वारा प्रधानमन्त्री र मन्त्रिमण्डललाई औपचारिक रूपबाट नियुक्त गरिन्छ, जबकि प्रधानमन्त्री नै मन्त्रिमण्डल छान्छन, र परम्पराको हिसाबबाट HM महारानी प्रधानमन्त्री को चुनावलाई सम्मान गर्दछिन । परम्परागत रूपबाट मन्त्रिमण्डल को दुबै विधायी सदनहरुमा प्रधानमन्त्रीको पार्टीको सदस्यहरुबाट लिईन्छ, र अधिकांशतः लोक सदनबाट, जसको प्रति वे जिम्मेदार छ.प्रधानमन्त्री र मंत्रिमंडल द्वारा कार्यपालिका शक्तियों का प्रयोग हुदछ, जो माननीय महारानी साहिबा का सबभन्दा सम्मानीय गुप्त परिषद मा शपथ लिन्छन र राजत्व को मन्त्री बन्छन .मजदूर दल को नेता, "Rt माननीय" गॉर्डन ब्राउन MP, प्रधानमन्त्री, कोष को पहिलो यहोवा र 27 जून 2007 पछी असैनिक सेवाको मन्त्री भैसकेका छन.

लोक सदनको चुनावको लागी, UK को वर्तमानमा 646 निर्वाचन क्षेत्रों मा विभाजित गरिएको छ, इंग्लैंडमा 529, उत्तरी आयरलैंडमा 18, स्कॉटलैंडमा 59, र वेल्समा 40, यद्यपि यो संख्या अगले आम चुनाव मा 650 सम्म बढेगी। प्रत्येक निर्वाचन क्षेत्र सरल बहुसंख्या द्वारा एक संसद सदस्य छान्दछ . प्रधानमन्त्रीको सलाहमा सम्राट द्वारा आम चुनाव आयोजित हुदछ. जबकि संसदको कुनै न्यूनतम अवधि हुँदैन, संसद ऐन (1911) को अनुसार पछिल्लो आम चुनावको पाँच बर्षको भित्र एक नया चुनाव को आयोजित गर्न आवश्यकता छ।

मजदूर दल, रूढ़िवादी पार्टी, र उदार प्रजातंत्रवादी UK को तीन प्रमुख राजनीतिक दल छन, जो 2005 को आम चुनावमा उनके बीच लोक सदनमा उपलब्ध 646 सीटहरु मध्ये 616 जीते। अधिकांश शेष स्थान उन दल द्वारा जीते गए जो UK को केवल एक हिस्सामा चुनाव लड़े जस्तो की स्कॉटिश राष्ट्रीय दल (केवल स्कॉटलैंड), प्लेड सयमरु (केवल वेल्स), र प्रजातान्त्रिक संघीय दल, सामाजिक प्रजातान्त्रिक र मजदूर दल, उल्स्टर संघीय पार्टी, र सिन् फेइन (केवल उत्तरी आयरलैंड, जबकि सिन् फेइन आयरलैंड मा पनि चुनाव लड्दछ)। दलको नीतिको अनुसार, कुनै पनि निर्वाचित सांसदको सिन् फेइन सदस्यले सदनमा आफ्नो घटकको तर्फबाट कुरा गर्नको लागी लोक सदनमा भाग नहीं लिया किनकी संसदको सदस्यों द्वारा सम्राटको प्रति निष्ठाको शपथ लेना आवश्यक छ।

यूरोपीय संसद मा चुनावको लागी, UK को पास वर्तमानमा 78 MEP छन, जो 12 बहु सदस्यीय निर्वाचन क्षेत्रबाट छनिएका हुन, जबकि 2009 को चुनाव मा यो कुल 72 सम्म गिर जाएगा. संप्रभुता मा सवाल यूरोपियन संघ मा UK को सदस्यताको कारण आगे ल्याईएको छ।

उत्तरी आयरलैंड, स्कॉटलैंड र वेल्स प्रत्येकको आफ्नो सरकार या कार्यकारी छ, पहिलो मन्त्री र एक निक्षेपण गरिएको सभा विधायिकाको नेतृत्व मा। इंग्लैंड, यूनाइटेड किंगडम का सबभन्दा ठुलो देश हो, को निक्षेपण गरिएको कार्यपालिका या विधायिका छैन र सबै मुद्दामा सीधै UK सरकार र संसद द्वारा प्रशासित र व्यवस्थित। यस स्थितिले पश्चिम लोथियन सवाल को बढावा दिईएको छ जो यस तथ्यबाट मतलब राख्दछ की उत्तरी आयरलैंड, स्कॉटलैंड र वेल्सको MP मतदानबाट सक्दछन, कहिले काही निर्णायक रूप से, इंग्लैंड को प्रभावित गर्ने मामिलाहरुमा जो की निक्षेपण गरिएको विधायिकाओं द्वारा उसको निर्वाचन क्षेत्रको लागी संभालिन्छ.

स्कॉटिश सरकार र संसद को कुनै पनि मामिलामा व्यापक अधिकार छ जो की विशेष रूपबाट UK को संसदको लागी 'आरक्षित' छैन, यसमा शिक्षा, स्वास्थ्य देखभाल, स्कॉट्स कानून र स्थानीय सरकार शामिल छ। 2007 को चुनावों मा आफ्नो जीत पछी, समर्थक स्वतंत्रता SNP ले अल्पमत सरकार का गठन गर्यो, जसको नेता थे, एलेक्स सैल्मोंड, जो स्कॉट्लैंडको पहिलो मन्त्री बने।

वेल्श विधानसभा सरकार र नेशनल असेंबली वेल्स को स्कॉटलैंड को निक्षेपण गरिएको बाट धेरै सीमित अधिकार छ, जबकी वेल्स सरकार ऐन 2006 पारित भए पछी, विधानसभा विधान योग्यता आदेश द्वारा अब केही क्षेत्रहरुमा व्यवस्था गर्न सक्दछ जो एक मामले को आधार प्रदान गर्न सकिन्छ। वर्तमान वेल्श विधानसभा सरकार का 2007 को चुनाव को केही हफ्तों पछी गठन गरिएको थियो, अल्पसंख्यक प्रशासनको एक संक्षिप्त अवधि पछी, जब प्लेड सयमरु एक गठबंधन सरकार मा लेबर पार्टीमा शामिल हुए, पहिलो मन्त्री रोड्री मॉर्गन को नेतृत्वको अधिन।

उत्तरी आयरलैंड कार्यकारी र सभा को पास स्कॉटलैंडमा निक्षेपण गरिएको जितनी शक्तियाँ छ.उत्तरी आयरलैंड कार्यकारी वर्तमानमा पहिलो मन्त्री पीटर रॉबिन्सन (प्रजातान्त्रिक संघीय पार्टी) र पहिलो उप मन्त्री मार्टीन मैकगुंइनेस (सिन् फेइन) को नेतृत्वमा छ.

यूनाइटेड किंगडमको प्रत्येक देशहरुमा स्थानीय सरकार को व्यवस्था अलग छ जो यूनाइटेड किंगडम मूल जितनी पुरानी हो। १९ औं शताब्दी सम्म उन व्यवस्थाहरुमा केही बदलाव थियो तर त्यस पछी भूमिका र कार्यमा एक निरंतर विकास हुआ. इंग्लैंड, उत्तरी आयरलैंड, स्कॉटलैंड र वेल्समा एक समान रूपमा परिवर्तन नहीं आया र स्थानीय सरकारबाटस्कट लैंड, वेल्स र उत्तरी आयरलैंड को सत्ताको हस्तांतरण का मतलब हे की भविष्य परिवर्तनको समान हुने संभावना छैन।

इंग्लैंडमा स्थानीय सरकार का संगठन जटिल छ, जब कृत्यों मा वितरण स्थानीय व्यवस्थाको हिसाबबाट बदलिन्छ। इंग्लैंड मा स्थानीय सरकारको व्यवस्था का UK संसद र यूनाइटेड किंगडम को सरकार द्वारा फैसला गरिन्छ, किनकी इंग्लैंडको एक निक्षेपण गरिएको संसद छैन।इंग्लैंड को ऊपरी-स्तरीय उपविभाग मा नौ सरकारी कार्यालय क्षेत्र या यूरोपीय संघ सरकार कार्यालय क्षेत्र छ. एक क्षेत्र, ग्रेटर लण्डन, 2000 पछी एक जनमत संग्रह मा यस प्रस्तावको लागी लोकप्रिय समर्थन पछी एक सीधे निर्वाचित विधानसभा र महापौर. यो इरादा थियो की अन्य क्षेत्रहरुमा पनि आफ्नो स्वयंको निर्वाचित क्षेत्रीय सभा दिईनेछ तर पूर्वोत्तर क्षेत्रमा 2004 मा एक जनमत संग्रह बाट प्रस्तावित सभाको अस्वीकृतिले बाटोमा नै यस विचार को रोक्यो।. क्षेत्र स्तरको नीचे, लण्डनमा 32 लन्दन नगर शामिल छ र इंग्लैंडको बाकी मा या तो काउंटी परिषद र जिल्ला परिषद या एकात्मक अधिकारि छ। सभासदहरुको पहिलो विगत यो पद द्वारा एक सदस्य आश्रितमा या बहु सदस्यीय बहुसंख्या प्रणाली द्वारा बहु सदस्यीय आश्रितमा नियुक्त गरिन्छ.

1973 बाट उत्तरी आयरलैंडमा स्थानीय सरकार, 26 जिल्ला परिषदहरुमा आयोजित गरिएको छ, प्रत्येक एकल संक्रमणीय मत द्वारा सेवाहरु सम्म सीमित शक्तिहरुको साथ निर्वाचित छैन जस्तो की कूड़ा इकट्ठा करना, कुत्तों को नियंत्रित करना, र पार्क को रेखदेख गर्नु र कब्रिस्तान। जबकि, 13 मार्च 2008 को, कार्यपालिकहरु ले मौजूदा व्यवस्था को बदल्नको लागी 11 नई परिषद बनाउने प्रस्तावों को सहमती दी र यसको लागी अगले स्तरको चुनाव 2011 सम्म स्थगित गरिनेछ।

स्कॉटलैंडमा स्थानीय सरकार को 32 परिषद क्षेत्र को आधार मा दुबै आकार र जनसंख्यामा व्यापक परिवर्तनको साथ बाडिएको छ। ग्लास्गो, एडिनबर्ग, एबर्डीन र डुन्डी शहर अलग परिषद क्षेत्र छ जस्तो की हाईलैंड परिषद् मा छ जसमा स्कॉटलैंड का एक तिहाई क्षेत्र छ तर सिर्फ 200000 मानिस रहन्छन। स्थानीय अधिकारीहरुमा निवेशित शक्ति निर्वाचित पार्षदहरुद्वारा प्रशासित हुदछ, जस मध्ये वर्तमानमा 1222 छैन जो आंशित वेतन पाउदछन। चुनाव को बहु सदस्यीय वार्डमा एकल संक्रमणीय मत द्वारा आयोजित गरिन्छ जो तीन या चार पार्षद छान्दछन। प्रत्येक परिषद् एक प्रोवोस्ट या संयोजक लाई छान्दछन जो परिषदको बैठकको अध्यक्षता करे र क्षेत्रको एक कल्पित सरदारको रूपमा कार्य करे। सभासद आचरणको संहिता को अधीन छन जो स्कॉटलैंडको मानक आयोग द्वारा लागू छ. स्कॉटलैंडको स्थानीय अधिकारीहरुको प्रतिनिधि संघ स्कॉटलैंडको स्थानीय अधिकारियों का समझौता (COSLA) छ.

वेल्स को स्थानीय सरकार मा 22 एकात्मक अधिकारीहरु शामिल छन जसमा कारडिफ्फ, स्वानसी र न्यूपोर्ट शामिल छन, जो आफैमा अलग एकात्मक अधिकारी हुन, पहिलो विगत यो पद द्वारा हर चार बर्षमा चुनाव आयोजित हुदछ, हालको चुनाव मई, 2008 मा भएको थियो। वेल्श स्थानीय सरकार एसोसिएशन वेल्सको स्थानीय अधिकारीहरुको हित का प्रतिनिधित्व गर्दछन।
